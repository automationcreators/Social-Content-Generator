I went from spending 3 hours every Friday on spreadsheets to having Claude Code generate my weekly sales reports automatically. Here's the exact workflow I use.\n\n## PROBLEM SETUP (15 seconds)\nMost small business owners waste hours on repetitive tasks. Manual reporting, data entry, customer follow-ups\u2014it all adds up. I was spending 15-20 hours per week on tasks that didn't grow my business.\n\n## CREDIBILITY (10 seconds)\nOver the past year, I've built 34 different automation projects using Claude Code. No coding background. Just learned to talk to AI effectively.\n\n## THE TRANSFORMATION (Main Content)\n\n### What I Built:\n\n\n**Example 1: How to: promptSaver**\n- **The Problem**: Manual processes were inefficient and time-consuming\n- **The Solution**: **Download the latest release**\n- **Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n- **Time to Build**: 45 minutes to 2 hours with Claude Code\n\n\n**Example 2: How to: vendor-quote-tool**\n- **The Problem**: Manual quote creation was taking hours and looked unprofessional\n- **The Solution**: **Create virtual environment**:\n- **Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n- **Time to Build**: 45 minutes to 2 hours with Claude Code\n\n\n**Example 3: How to: YouTubeRAG**\n- **The Problem**: Manual processes were inefficient and time-consuming\n- **The Solution**: Add tests for new functionality\n- **Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n- **Time to Build**: 45 minutes to 2 hours with Claude Code\n\n\n### The Numbers (Show on screen):\n\n- 34 active projects - Managing 3,168 files across diverse projects\n- 26 projects with autonomous agents - Built 51 custom agents\n- 34 active projects - All built and managed with Claude Code\n- 26 projects with autonomous agents - Autonomous agents handling business operations\n\n\n## THE FRAMEWORK (How You Can Do This)\n\nI use a simple 3-step process:\n\n**Step 1: Describe What You Do Manually**\nWrite out your current process like you're explaining it to an assistant. Be specific about inputs, outputs, and edge cases.\n\n**Step 2: Talk to Claude Code Like a Human**\nNo coding jargon needed. I literally say: \"Build me a system that [does the thing].\"\n\nExample: \"Build me a quote generator that takes my pricing list, creates professional PDFs, and emails them to customers.\"\n\n**Step 3: Test and Refine**\nClaude builds it. You test it. You tell Claude what to fix. Repeat until it's perfect.\n\n## REAL EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH\n\nLet me show you exactly how I built How to: promptSaver...\n\n[Screen recording showing the actual conversation with Claude Code]\n\n## PROOF (Show the Results)\n\nHere's the actual tool running: [Demo the real project]\n\nThis replaced:\n- Manual processes\n- Saving me 10 hours/week\n- One-time setup, runs forever\n\n## CONTRARIAN TAKE\n\nEveryone thinks you need to:\n- Learn to code\n- Hire developers\n- Use expensive SaaS tools\n\nWrong. You need:\n- Clear idea of what you want\n- Ability to explain it to Claude\n- 30-60 minutes of setup time\n\n## CALL TO ACTION\n\nStart with ONE repetitive task. The thing that annoys you most. Describe it to Claude Code. See what happens.\n\nDrop a comment with what you want to automate and I'll help you structure the prompt.\n\n## END SCREEN\n- Link to my other Claude Code tutorials\n- Subscribe for more automation content\n- Join my newsletter for the exact prompts I use\n\n---\n**Estimated Length**: 8-12 minutes\n**Key Visuals**: Screen recordings of actual projects, before/after comparisons, statistics overlays\n",

I went from spending 3 hours every Friday on spreadsheets to having Claude Code generate my weekly sales reports automatically. Here's the exact workflow I use.\n\n## The Reality Check\n\nI manage 34 active projects.\nI'm not a professional developer.\nI don't have a dev team.\n\nWhat I have: Claude Code and a clear understanding of what I need.\n\n## What I've Built (Real Examples)\n\n### How to: promptSaver\n\n**The Challenge**: Manual processes were inefficient and time-consuming\n\n**The Solution**: **Download the latest release**\n\n**Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n\n**Tech Stack**: JavaScript/React, Web\n\n**Build Time**: Less than 2 hours from idea to working prototype\n\n---\n\n### How to: vendor-quote-tool\n\n**The Challenge**: Manual quote creation was taking hours and looked unprofessional\n\n**The Solution**: **Create virtual environment**:\n\n**Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n\n**Tech Stack**: Python, JavaScript/React, Web\n\n**Build Time**: Less than 2 hours from idea to working prototype\n\n---\n\n### How to: YouTubeRAG\n\n**The Challenge**: Manual processes were inefficient and time-consuming\n\n**The Solution**: Add tests for new functionality\n\n**Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n\n**Tech Stack**: Python, JavaScript/React, Web\n\n**Build Time**: Less than 2 hours from idea to working prototype\n\n---\n\n## The Numbers Don't Lie\n\n- **34 active projects**: Managing 3,168 files across diverse projects\n- **26 projects with autonomous agents**: Built 51 custom agents\n- **34 active projects**: All built and managed with Claude Code\n- **26 projects with autonomous agents**: Autonomous agents handling business operations\n\n\n## How This Changes Everything\n\nTraditional approach:\n1. Define requirements (weeks)\n2. Find/hire developers (months)\n3. Development (months)\n4. Testing and iteration (weeks)\n5. Maintenance costs (ongoing)\n\nMy approach with Claude Code:\n1. Describe what I need (5 minutes)\n2. Let Claude build it (30-60 minutes)\n3. Test and refine (15 minutes)\n4. Run it (forever, for free)\n\n## The Framework I Use\n\n**Step 1: Think in Outcomes, Not Code**\n\nI don't think \"I need a Python script that...\"\n\nI think \"I need a system that emails me when customers haven't ordered in 30 days.\"\n\n**Step 2: Describe It Like Delegating**\n\nTalk to Claude like you're delegating to a very capable assistant:\n\n\"Build me a dashboard that shows:\n- Today's sales vs. last week\n- Top 5 customers by revenue\n- Products that need reordering\n- Pull data from my Google Sheet\n- Update every hour\"\n\nClaude knows how to translate that into code.\n\n**Step 3: Iterate Based on Results**\n\nThe first version works. But you'll want tweaks:\n- \"Add email alerts when sales drop 20%\"\n- \"Make the chart show last 30 days instead of 7\"\n- \"Export to PDF for my weekly meeting\"\n\nJust tell Claude. It adjusts.\n\n## Why This Matters for Small Business\n\nBig companies have advantages:\n- Unlimited dev resources\n- Custom software for everything\n- Automation at scale\n\nSmall businesses now have Claude Code:\n- Build anything you can describe\n- No coding required\n- No monthly subscriptions\n- Runs 24/7\n\nIt's not about competing. It's about having the same capabilities without the overhead.\n\n## Start Here\n\nPick ONE task that wastes your time every week:\n- Weekly reporting\n- Customer follow-ups\n- Data entry\n- Inventory tracking\n- Quote generation\n\nDescribe it to Claude Code.\n\nThat's it.\n\n## What Are You Automating?\n\nI'm documenting my entire journey building with Claude Code.\n\nComment below with one task you want to automate and I'll help you structure the prompt to get started.\n\n---\n\n**Building in public with Claude Code.**\n\n#ClaudeCode #SmallBusiness #Automation #AI #Productivity #BuildingInPublic\n",

I taught Claude Code my business workflows once. Now it handles customer follow-ups, invoice reminders, and data entry while I focus on growth.\n\n## PROBLEM SETUP (15 seconds)\nMost small business owners waste hours on repetitive tasks. Manual reporting, data entry, customer follow-ups\u2014it all adds up. I was spending 15-20 hours per week on tasks that didn't grow my business.\n\n## CREDIBILITY (10 seconds)\nOver the past year, I've built 34 different automation projects using Claude Code. No coding background. Just learned to talk to AI effectively.\n\n## THE TRANSFORMATION (Main Content)\n\n### What I Built:\n\n\n**Example 1: How to: promptSaver**\n- **The Problem**: Manual processes were inefficient and time-consuming\n- **The Solution**: **Download the latest release**\n- **Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n- **Time to Build**: 45 minutes to 2 hours with Claude Code\n\n\n**Example 2: How to: vendor-quote-tool**\n- **The Problem**: Manual quote creation was taking hours and looked unprofessional\n- **The Solution**: **Create virtual environment**:\n- **Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n- **Time to Build**: 45 minutes to 2 hours with Claude Code\n\n\n**Example 3: How to: YouTubeRAG**\n- **The Problem**: Manual processes were inefficient and time-consuming\n- **The Solution**: Add tests for new functionality\n- **Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n- **Time to Build**: 45 minutes to 2 hours with Claude Code\n\n\n### The Numbers (Show on screen):\n\n- 34 active projects - All built and managed with Claude Code\n- 26 projects with autonomous agents - Autonomous agents handling business operations\n\n\n## THE FRAMEWORK (How You Can Do This)\n\nI use a simple 3-step process:\n\n**Step 1: Describe What You Do Manually**\nWrite out your current process like you're explaining it to an assistant. Be specific about inputs, outputs, and edge cases.\n\n**Step 2: Talk to Claude Code Like a Human**\nNo coding jargon needed. I literally say: \"Build me a system that [does the thing].\"\n\nExample: \"Build me a quote generator that takes my pricing list, creates professional PDFs, and emails them to customers.\"\n\n**Step 3: Test and Refine**\nClaude builds it. You test it. You tell Claude what to fix. Repeat until it's perfect.\n\n## REAL EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH\n\nLet me show you exactly how I built How to: promptSaver...\n\n[Screen recording showing the actual conversation with Claude Code]\n\n## PROOF (Show the Results)\n\nHere's the actual tool running: [Demo the real project]\n\nThis replaced:\n- Manual processes\n- Saving me 10 hours/week\n- One-time setup, runs forever\n\n## CONTRARIAN TAKE\n\nEveryone thinks you need to:\n- Learn to code\n- Hire developers\n- Use expensive SaaS tools\n\nWrong. You need:\n- Clear idea of what you want\n- Ability to explain it to Claude\n- 30-60 minutes of setup time\n\n## CALL TO ACTION\n\nStart with ONE repetitive task. The thing that annoys you most. Describe it to Claude Code. See what happens.\n\nDrop a comment with what you want to automate and I'll help you structure the prompt.\n\n## END SCREEN\n- Link to my other Claude Code tutorials\n- Subscribe for more automation content\n- Join my newsletter for the exact prompts I use\n\n---\n**Estimated Length**: 8-12 minutes\n**Key Visuals**: Screen recordings of actual projects, before/after comparisons, statistics overlays\n",

I taught Claude Code my business workflows once. Now it handles customer follow-ups, invoice reminders, and data entry while I focus on growth.\n\n## The Reality Check\n\nI manage 34 active projects.\nI'm not a professional developer.\nI don't have a dev team.\n\nWhat I have: Claude Code and a clear understanding of what I need.\n\n## What I've Built (Real Examples)\n\n### How to: promptSaver\n\n**The Challenge**: Manual processes were inefficient and time-consuming\n\n**The Solution**: **Download the latest release**\n\n**Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n\n**Tech Stack**: JavaScript/React, Web\n\n**Build Time**: Less than 2 hours from idea to working prototype\n\n---\n\n### How to: vendor-quote-tool\n\n**The Challenge**: Manual quote creation was taking hours and looked unprofessional\n\n**The Solution**: **Create virtual environment**:\n\n**Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n\n**Tech Stack**: Python, JavaScript/React, Web\n\n**Build Time**: Less than 2 hours from idea to working prototype\n\n---\n\n### How to: YouTubeRAG\n\n**The Challenge**: Manual processes were inefficient and time-consuming\n\n**The Solution**: Add tests for new functionality\n\n**Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n\n**Tech Stack**: Python, JavaScript/React, Web\n\n**Build Time**: Less than 2 hours from idea to working prototype\n\n---\n\n## The Numbers Don't Lie\n\n- **34 active projects**: All built and managed with Claude Code\n- **26 projects with autonomous agents**: Autonomous agents handling business operations\n\n\n## How This Changes Everything\n\nTraditional approach:\n1. Define requirements (weeks)\n2. Find/hire developers (months)\n3. Development (months)\n4. Testing and iteration (weeks)\n5. Maintenance costs (ongoing)\n\nMy approach with Claude Code:\n1. Describe what I need (5 minutes)\n2. Let Claude build it (30-60 minutes)\n3. Test and refine (15 minutes)\n4. Run it (forever, for free)\n\n## The Framework I Use\n\n**Step 1: Think in Outcomes, Not Code**\n\nI don't think \"I need a Python script that...\"\n\nI think \"I need a system that emails me when customers haven't ordered in 30 days.\"\n\n**Step 2: Describe It Like Delegating**\n\nTalk to Claude like you're delegating to a very capable assistant:\n\n\"Build me a dashboard that shows:\n- Today's sales vs. last week\n- Top 5 customers by revenue\n- Products that need reordering\n- Pull data from my Google Sheet\n- Update every hour\"\n\nClaude knows how to translate that into code.\n\n**Step 3: Iterate Based on Results**\n\nThe first version works. But you'll want tweaks:\n- \"Add email alerts when sales drop 20%\"\n- \"Make the chart show last 30 days instead of 7\"\n- \"Export to PDF for my weekly meeting\"\n\nJust tell Claude. It adjusts.\n\n## Why This Matters for Small Business\n\nBig companies have advantages:\n- Unlimited dev resources\n- Custom software for everything\n- Automation at scale\n\nSmall businesses now have Claude Code:\n- Build anything you can describe\n- No coding required\n- No monthly subscriptions\n- Runs 24/7\n\nIt's not about competing. It's about having the same capabilities without the overhead.\n\n## Start Here\n\nPick ONE task that wastes your time every week:\n- Weekly reporting\n- Customer follow-ups\n- Data entry\n- Inventory tracking\n- Quote generation\n\nDescribe it to Claude Code.\n\nThat's it.\n\n## What Are You Automating?\n\nI'm documenting my entire journey building with Claude Code.\n\nComment below with one task you want to automate and I'll help you structure the prompt to get started.\n\n---\n\n**Building in public with Claude Code.**\n\n#ClaudeCode #SmallBusiness #Automation #AI #Productivity #BuildingInPublic\n",

Claude Code does it all\u2014custom-built for MY business, not a generic solution. Here's how I set it up in an afternoon.\n\n## PROBLEM SETUP (15 seconds)\nMost small business owners waste hours on repetitive tasks. Manual reporting, data entry, customer follow-ups\u2014it all adds up. I was spending 15-20 hours per week on tasks that didn't grow my business.\n\n## CREDIBILITY (10 seconds)\nOver the past year, I've built 34 different automation projects using Claude Code. No coding background. Just learned to talk to AI effectively.\n\n## THE TRANSFORMATION (Main Content)\n\n### What I Built:\n\n\n**Example 1: How to: promptSaver**\n- **The Problem**: Manual processes were inefficient and time-consuming\n- **The Solution**: **Download the latest release**\n- **Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n- **Time to Build**: 45 minutes to 2 hours with Claude Code\n\n\n**Example 2: How to: vendor-quote-tool**\n- **The Problem**: Manual quote creation was taking hours and looked unprofessional\n- **The Solution**: **Create virtual environment**:\n- **Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n- **Time to Build**: 45 minutes to 2 hours with Claude Code\n\n\n**Example 3: How to: YouTubeRAG**\n- **The Problem**: Manual processes were inefficient and time-consuming\n- **The Solution**: Add tests for new functionality\n- **Business Impact**: Step-by-step implementation\n- **Time to Build**: 45 minutes to 2 hours with Claude Code\n\n\n### The Numbers (Show on screen):\n\n- 34 active projects - Managing 3,168 files across diverse projects\n- 26 projects with autonomous agents - Built 51 custom agents\n- 34 active projects - All built and managed with Claude Code\n- 26 projects with autonomous agents - Autonomous agents handling business operations\n\n\n## THE FRAMEWORK (How You Can Do This)\n\nI use a simple 3-step process:\n\n**Step 1: Describe What You Do Manually**\nWrite out your current process like you're explaining it to an assistant. Be specific about inputs, outputs, and edge cases.\n\n**Step 2: Talk to Claude Code Like a Human**\nNo coding jargon needed. I literally say: \"Build me a system that [does the thing].\"\n\nExample: \"Build me a quote generator that takes my pricing list, creates professional PDFs, and emails them to customers.\"\n\n**Step 3: Test and Refine**\nClaude builds it. You test it. You tell Claude what to fix. Repeat until it's perfect.\n\n## REAL EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH\n\nLet me show you exactly how I built How to: promptSaver...\n\n[Screen recording showing the actual conversation with Claude Code]\n\n## PROOF (Show the Results)\n\nHere's the actual tool running: [Demo the real project]\n\nThis replaced:\n- Manual processes\n- Saving me 10 hours/week\n- One-time setup, runs forever\n\n## CONTRARIAN TAKE\n\nEveryone thinks you need to:\n- Learn to code\n- Hire developers\n- Use expensive SaaS tools\n\nWrong. You need:\n- Clear idea of what you want\n- Ability to explain it to Claude\n- 30-60 minutes of setup time\n\n## CALL TO ACTION\n\nStart with ONE repetitive task. The thing that annoys you most. Describe it to Claude Code. See what happens.\n\nDrop a comment with what you want to automate and I'll help you structure the prompt.\n\n## END SCREEN\n- Link to my other Claude Code tutorials\n- Subscribe for more automation content\n- Join my newsletter for the exact prompts I use\n\n---\n**Estimated Length**: 8-12 minutes\n**Key Visuals**: Screen recordings of actual projects, before/after comparisons, statistics overlays\n",

Define requirements (weeks)\n2. Find/hire developers (months)\n3. Development (months)\n4. Testing and iteration (weeks)\n5. Maintenance costs (ongoing)\n\nMy approach with Claude Code:\n1. Describe what I need (5 minutes)\n2. Let Claude build it (30-60 minutes)\n3. Test and refine (15 minutes)\n4. Run it (forever, for free)\n\n## The Framework I Use\n\n**Step 1: Think in Outcomes, Not Code**\n\nI don't think \"I need a Python script that...\"\n\nI think \"I need a system that emails me when customers haven't ordered in 30 days.\"\n\n**Step 2: Describe It Like Delegating**\n\nTalk to Claude like you're delegating to a very capable assistant:\n\n\"Build me a dashboard that shows:\n- Today's sales vs. last week\n- Top 5 customers by revenue\n- Products that need reordering\n- Pull data from my Google Sheet\n- Update every hour\"\n\nClaude knows how to translate that into code.\n\n**Step 3: Iterate Based on Results**\n\nThe first version works. But you'll want tweaks:\n- \"Add email alerts when sales drop 20%\"\n- \"Make the chart show last 30 days instead of 7\"\n- \"Export to PDF for my weekly meeting\"\n\nJust tell Claude. It adjusts.\n\n## Why This Matters for Small Business\n\nBig companies have advantages:\n- Unlimited dev resources\n- Custom software for everything\n- Automation at scale\n\nSmall businesses now have Claude Code:\n- Build anything you can describe\n- No coding required\n- No monthly subscriptions\n- Runs 24/7\n\nIt's not about competing. It's about having the same capabilities without the overhead.\n\n## Start Here\n\nPick ONE task that wastes your time every week:\n- Weekly reporting\n- Customer follow-ups\n- Data entry\n- Inventory tracking\n- Quote generation\n\nDescribe it to Claude Code.\n\nThat's it.\n\n## What Are You Automating?\n\nI'm documenting my entire journey building with Claude Code.\n\nComment below with one task you want to automate and I'll help you structure the prompt to get started.\n\n---\n\n**Building in public with Claude Code.**\n\n#ClaudeCode #SmallBusiness #Automation #AI #Productivity #BuildingInPublic\n",
