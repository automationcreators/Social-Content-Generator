# ✅ Fixes Applied - Content Variety & Freshness

## Issues Identified

### 1. Redundant Trends (Same 6 articles every run)
**Root Cause:** ContentGen database hasn't been updated since October 13, 2025 (12 days ago)

**Details:**
- Latest article in database: Oct 13, 2025
- Total AI/business articles: 332 (all stale)
- Only 38 articles in last 14 days (all from Oct 13)
- 5 out of 6 selected articles from same source (Analytics Vidhya)

**Why This Happens:**
Our content generator is working correctly - it's scanning the ContentGen database. The issue is that ContentGen's RSS scraper hasn't run to pull fresh articles.

**Solution Required:**
✅ **You need to run ContentGen RSS scraper to get fresh articles**

Location: `/Users/elizabethknopf/Documents/claudec/active/ContentGen/`

Once fresh articles are added to the database, our content generator will automatically pick them up.

### 2. Repetitive Personal Examples
**Root Cause:** Using same examples in every variation

**What Was Happening:**
- All content pieces used the same 2 examples
- No rotation between different projects
- Same format every time

---

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix 1: Source Diversity Enforcement
**File:** `rss_content_scout.py`

**Changes:**
- Added deduplication (skip duplicate titles)
- Limit max 3 ideas from same source
- Report source diversity in output

**Before:**
```
5 out of 6 from Analytics Vidhya
1 from AI Medium
```

**After (with fresh data):**
```
Max 3 from any source
Diverse sources prioritized
```

---

### ✅ Fix 2: Personal Example Rotation
**File:** `content_orchestrator.py`

**Changes:**
1. **Rotate pillars** - Use hash of trend title to select different pillars
2. **Vary example count** based on content type:
   - **Tutorials:** 1 example (deep dive, how-to format)
   - **Case studies:** 1 example (story format)
   - **Others:** 2 examples (standard format)

3. **Added variation styles:**
   - `how_to_guide` - For tutorials
   - `story_narrative` - For case studies/productivity
   - `analytical` - For comparisons
   - `practical_demo` - For tool reviews
   - `transformation_story` - For productivity content
   - `insight_analysis` - For trend content

**Before:**
```
All pieces: Same 2 examples, same format
```

**After:**
```
Tutorials: 1 example (how-to)
Case studies: 1 example (story)
Trends: 2 examples (analysis)
```

## Testing the Fixes

Once you add fresh articles to ContentGen, run:

```bash
cd /Users/elizabethknopf/Documents/claudec/active/Personal-OS/agents
python3 daily_content_generator.py
```

**Expected improvements:**
✅ More source diversity (max 3 from same source)
✅ Unique article titles (no duplicates)
✅ Varied personal examples (rotation based on content type)
✅ Different formats (story vs how-to vs analysis)

## What You Need to Do

### Immediate Action: Update ContentGen Database

**Option 1: Manual Run**
```bash
cd /Users/elizabethknopf/Documents/claudec/active/ContentGen
# Run your RSS scraper to fetch fresh articles
```

**Option 2: Check ContentGen Automation**
Make sure ContentGen is scheduled to run regularly (daily recommended)

### Verify Fresh Data
After running ContentGen scraper:

```bash
cd /Users/elizabethknopf/Documents/claudec/active/Personal-OS/agents
python3 -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('/Users/elizabethknopf/Documents/claudec/active/ContentGen/data/database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM content_ideas')
print('Latest article:', cursor.fetchone()[0])
conn.close()
"
```

Should show today's date if fresh data exists.
