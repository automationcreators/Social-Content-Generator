## Variation 1: Contrarian Angle

**Title:** Stop Using AI Tools (Do This Instead) | Claude Skills Vs Traditional Automation Tools

**Strategic Reasoning:** Appeals to sophisticated buyers skeptical of AI hype. Best for LinkedIn and business-focused audiences. Tests contrarian positioning.

### Hook (Kallaway's 4-Part Structure)

**Pattern Interrupt:** Stop buying AI tools.

**Challenge:** 95% of AI pilots fail because companies chase features instead of redesigning workflows first.

**Promise:** Here's the MIT-backed approach that doubles ROI:

**Credibility:** Seeing this work in real M&A due diligence


### Body: WHY-WHAT-HOW Framework

#### WHY WHY this matters

- The business case for Claude Skills vs traditional automation tools (MIT: workflow redesign first = 2x ROI)
- Why 95% of implementations fail (S&P Global: wrong sequence)
- The compound leverage opportunity most people miss

**Pattern Break:** But here's what nobody tells you...

#### WHAT WHAT actually works

**Framework:**
1. Start with ONE process (not the whole business)
1. Map current workflow (before touching AI)
1. Identify decision points vs execution steps
1. Automate execution, augment decisions
1. Measure baseline vs automated performance

**Example:** Real example: $500M client case study

#### HOW HOW to implement this week

Step 1: Pick your highest-cost manual process
Step 2: Document current workflow (30 minutes)
Step 3: Identify automation candidates (pattern recognition tasks)
Step 4: Build MVP automation (focus on 80% case)
Step 5: Test, measure, iterate before scaling

**Closer:** This is how professionals implement AI - not by chasing features, but by redesigning for leverage.
