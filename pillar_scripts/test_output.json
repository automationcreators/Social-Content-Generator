Every new project adds another 30-60 minutes of weekly overhead.\n\nYou hit a ceiling where you literally can't take on new work because you're drowning in project admin."

Run it daily via cron.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### System 2: Template Generator\n\n**What it does:**\n- Creates new project structure in one command\n- Auto-generates CLAUDE.md with context\n- Assigns unique localhost ports\n- Sets up security defaults\n\n**Business impact:** 2 hours \u2192 5 minutes per project (96% reduction)\n\n**How to build:**\n```\nPrompt Claude: \"Create a project template generator that accepts a project name, creates directory structure, generates CLAUDE.md from template, assigns available port from range 3000-9000, and initializes git repo.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### System 3: GitHub Sync Agent\n\n**What it does:**\n- Auto-commits changes daily\n- Creates pull requests with summaries\n- Monitors CI/CD status\n- Sends failure notifications\n\n**Business impact:** Zero manual git operations across 34 projects\n\n**How to build:**\n```\nPrompt Claude: \"Build an agent that runs daily, checks for uncommitted changes in a list of project directories, creates meaningful commit messages based on file changes, commits and pushes, and creates PRs when on feature branches.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Connecting the Systems\n\nAll three run via a daily scheduler:\n- 9:00 AM: Project discovery scans everything\n- 9:05 AM: Todo aggregation compiles cross-project tasks\n- 9:10 AM: GitHub sync commits and pushes changes\n- 9:15 AM: Dashboard updates with latest data\n\nYou wake up to a complete project status report. No manual work required."
