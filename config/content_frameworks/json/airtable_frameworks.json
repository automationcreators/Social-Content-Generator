      "full_template": "\u201cWhy do I have to pick a niche? Slack didn\u2019t have to pick a niche!\u201d\u2014 every founder ever.\n\nEvery startup that\u2019s doing something new faces a challenge when moving from risk-tolerant early adopters to risk-averse mainstream buyers. How do I (the founder) convince the latter to take a bet on my small, unproven company?\n\nUnlike early adopters, the early mainstream market wants much more than software. They want:\n\n\u2192 deep support & documentation\n\n\u2192 onboarding, training, change management\n\n\u2192 pre-built integrations\n\n\u2192 partnerships in their industry\n\n\u2192 3rd party support\n\n\u2192 a fleshed-out ecosystem\n\n\u2192 a compelling use case \n\nAll these factors reduce the perceived risk of investing time and energy into a startup. This jump from visionaries (who are happy to shoulder the burden of the above list) to the pragmatists (who are not) has been called the \u201cchasm\u201d\u2014 a concept popularized by Geoffrey Moore.\n\nThe traditional path to winning the hearts of the early majority is by picking a niche segment and simply delivering the \u201cwhole product\u201d for them (i.e. the software and everything from the list above). The reason you can only do this for one niche at a time is because each segment needs a different set of requirements beyond the software itself\u2014 and no small startup can deliver multiple different \u201cwhole products\u201d at once.\n\nExamples of companies that grew from this strategy are Gusto and Square (as you can hear about in an excellent episode of First Round Capital\u2019s In Depth podcast) and Tesla. However, there is another way that companies cross the chasm: they can borrow credibility from millions and millions of passionate users acquired from a more horizontal PLG approach.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to approach a company and say \u201ctake a bet on us\u201d\u2026and another to say \u201c40% of your employees ALREADY use us.\u201d The bottoms-up approach has been used very effectively by companies like Notion, Airtable, and Slack. \n\nThe goal is to get so many users that you\u2019re a household name by the time you approach the majority for more end-to-end adoption. An added benefit \u2014 the passionate community effectively creates the \u201cwhole product\u201d for you (as we see with the countless user-generated templates, trainings, etc. created by Notion and Airtable users).\n\nThis second approach requires:\n\n1. a fast time to value for individual and team users\n\n1. that can adopt the product self-serve\n\n1. and be reached through highly leveraged, viral distribution mechanisms\n\n1. and ultimately lead to millions and millions of users. \n\n#productmarketing #gotomarket #startups\n"

They're surprising.\n\nLet's break them down: Reminder... this is the interview where they ask questions like: Improve ChatGPT. How would you differentiate Reels from TikTok? What's your fave product? How would you improve it? And why should you care about Meta related to this?\n\nMeta originated product sense interviews back in '08. Their criteria have propagated to the rest of the industry.\n\nI saw similar ones when I worked at Affirm and Apollo. Here's the details:\n\nCriteria 1 \u2014 Understanding the product landscape and motivation. A great product sense interview response actually goes through: \n\nWhat problem are we solving? \n\nWhat business goal is this achieving? \n\nWhat are the competitive alternatives?\n\nSo, your interview framework should give you the opportunity to answer all 3 of these questions.\n\nCriteria 2 \u2014 Determining the audience or people using the product. Product case interviews worship at the altar of the user.\n\nIt's important to not just identify who the user is, but who are the people who matter in the ecosystem?\n\nEG, a common 'gotcha' in marketplace questions is when the interviewee only focuses on one side of the equation. \n\n(Think creators and consumers.)\n\nCriteria 3 \u2014 Identifying and prioritizing the problem. The biggest mistake people who haven't practiced much make is jumping straight into solutions.\n\nThe biggest mistake people who have practiced make is not exploring a variety of problems.\n\nIt's critical to brainstorm several problems, and then prioritize one. \n\nAnd provide a good reason why.\n\nCriteria 4 \u2014 Developing creative and impactful solutions. Once you've narrowed into one problem, you can't just get excited about one awesome solution.\n\nYou need to brainstorm several creative ones\u2014that the interviewer hasn't heard before.\n\nGoing back to the user and business problem can help you think outside the box.\n\nCriteria 5 \u2014 Making intentional design choices. It's counter-intuitive, because the product sense interview and product design interview are often different...\n\nBut you should actually get into some design choices in your product sense interview.\n\nIn fact, a key component of real-world product sense is design. \n\nSo don't cut short your framework or answer.\n\nI know several people who have aced all their interviews except product sense. \n\nAnd they didn't get the offer.\n\nDon't neglect this round.\n"

I just got back from international business travel Thursday\u2014I have 4 more trips in the next 4 weeks\u2014and now I'm painting... and having fun doing it.\n\nMy whole life I've worked hard. \n\nBy my senior year I was the fastest high school swimmer in the state of Texas. I studied and swam at Princeton.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, I started Cheers in my dorm room. \n\nPeople always ask: \"Where do you find the motivation?\" \n\nOr: \"How do you find the energy to work so hard?\" \n\nThe answer lies in how I view work... I fundamentally view work as a GOOD THING. \n\nIt's not something to be avoided. \n\nThere is joy in work for its own merit\u2014even if you're not getting paid much\u2014though... that's a nice plus if you can make a good wage doing it!\n\nI'm a Christian, and in Genesis, the Lord calls humankind to essentially 1) procreate and 2) subdue the Earth\u2014and together that is part of their worship and service to God. \n\nThe idea is pretty simple... humankind are inherently workers meant to make things better than they found it.\n\nWhy I don't like the idea of a 'work-life balance' is that it pretty much only ever strikes one direction. \n\nSomeone who works a lot has a 'bad' balance and someone who works less has a 'good' balance. \n\nHave you ever heard someone say: \"I have a bad work-life balance... I work far too little!\"? \ud83e\udd23\n\nI believe working less is the wrong ideal.\n\nI'm not saying all work is fun. Layoffs aren't fun. \n\nShit hitting the fan is not fun. Having to stay up all night fixing someone else's problem isn't fun.\n\nBut what I am saying is that if you can find a way to see work as a blessing in and of itself, you'll really find a lot of joy in your life. \n\nAll the entrepreneurs I meet with love working. They love the challenge.\n\nThey love helping people\u2014customers, employees, vendors, etc.\n\nIn the past month I have met two different groups: 1) Shark Tank alumni, and 2) some of the most successful sellers on Amazon. \n\nIn both groups many of the people there had already made multiple lifetimes worth of money\u2014they had no need to work. \n\nSo why were they working? Why weren't they retiring?\n\nHint... it's not because they want a private plane or yacht... or some other vain thing. \n\nIt's because they find joy in the work they do.\n\nThis Labor Day try to find joy in work. \n\nThat may mean a career switch. \n\nBut it also may just mean taking a different view of the work you do. \n\nEven if you work for a greedy corporation you can find ways to make the lives of your co-workers or customers better. \n\nAnd that gives joy!\n"

Total annual cost (bottom line) savings is about $4000, with zero pain. \n\nThis was purely clean up of items and services I did not need at levels that were not right for me.

The Two-Day Rule  \nWith whatever habit you're trying to build, never allow yourself to skip more than one day in a row.  \n\nQuoting a study in the European Journal of Social Psychology: \"Missing one opportunity to perform the behaviour did not materially affect the habit formation process.\"  \n\nSkipping one day won't hurt your habit building, as long as you don't skip the next one.  \n\n1. Habit Stacking  \nJames Clear famously pointed out that we execute on Daily Systems most effectively when they are fixed to a time or action that makes them easy to structure and regiment.  \n\nHe calls this Habit Stacking:  \n\u2022 \"I'll journal 30 minutes before bed.\"  \n\u2022 \"I\u2019ll do 25 pushups when I get out of bed.\"  \n\u2022 \"I'll read 30 minutes of my favorite novel while doing cardio.\"  \n\nIt's a simple, effective behavioral trick to execute against Daily Systems.  \n\n1. Minimum Viable Progress  \nNever skip a day, but anything above zero counts.  \n\nHave a goal in mind to do 30 minutes of the action every single day\u2014but if you can\u2019t hit that, just do any tiny amount above zero.  \n\nRemember: Anything above zero compounds!  \n\n\\*\\*\\*If you leverage those four simple models, you will 10x your execution in 2024 and reach new heights.\n"

It's more important to have massive impact than be liked. \n\nThere's a tendency to want to please people\u2014not just when you begin, even when you join a new team or company. But the way to earn respect and career advancement as a PM has nothing to do with how agreeable you are. \n\nIn fact, some of the best PMs I worked with were so laser focused on impact, it was impossible to get anything on their roadmap. It's not that they were bad teammates. \n\nThey were \"givers\" in the Adam Grant sense. But they didn't make sacrifices when it comes to the roadmap just because: \n\nTheir boss said so. \n\nSomeone is 3 levels above them. \n\nAn entire department thinks it's an obvious idea. \n\nAll PMs need to master the, \"we'll investigate that,\" and avoid, \"we'll build that.\" \n\nMost colleagues don't like that you are the decision maker. \n\nImagine you're a marketer with 15 years of experience selling to this exact buyer. You know their needs inside-out. \n\n\"And this PM doesn't think I know what's best to build?! They hardly have 2 years experience in this industry\u2026\" \n\nThis is how many stakeholders, especially with domain expertise, feel. Meanwhile, designers and engineers are worried about their careers. \n\nThey understand the deciding making power, but they don't like it. \"This affects my career if they get it wrong!\" \n\nEvery PM has to earn their stripes with every stakeholder. \n\nMost PM jobs are 60 hours, not 40. This is the one people are going to have their pitchforks out for in the comments. \n\nI get it. I worked at an amazing, 40-hour a week place: thredUP. \n\nBut, in my other PM jobs, that wasn't the reality for high performers. And that's true with most other PM jobs: Meta, Amazon, fast growing startups\u2026 \n\nYou end up spending the normal 40 hour week on: \n\nSlack. \n\nMeetings. \n\nUrgent Stuff. \n\nThen you spend time outside work actually writing quality documents and emails. \n\nIf PMs go in with the right expectation that this is what it takes to be a high performer, they are much better off.\n\nThe more responsive, the better. This is a hard one to accept. \n\nThe psychological advice tells us, \"don't always be online.\" And for folks struggling with work-life balance, it's hard to hear. \n\nBut, as a PM, being glue is quite important. And you lose your role as reliable glue if you aren't fast. \n\nYou can think of it like two roads: one fast, one slow. You might use the slow one a few times. \n\nBut over time, you'll just switch to always using the fast one. \n\nBatching slack messages to 3 times a day can work for some professions. Nowhere that I worked does it work for PMs. \n\nResponsiveness matters. I know people will be disappointed to hear many of these things. \n\nSound off about how I'm glamorizing overworking, American culture in the comments. But, I did tell you: these are harsh truths.\n"

Here's what I learned: \n\nGlobally, the numbers are pedestrian: \n\n16% of PMs have a portfolio. \n\n61% know of them, but don't have one. \n\n23% have never even heard of one! \n\nBut - the percentage using them is growing steadily. \n\nThe ascent has been accelerated with 3 bumps: \n\nThe dot com era brought many more people into tech, resulting in some competing with portfolios. \n\nThe great financial crisis led to myriad layoffs, prompting struggling PMs to adopt them. \n\nThe ZIRP era led to a huge expansion of the field, driving former designers and engineers to switch and bring along their portfolios. \n\nBut this pick up hasn't been global. \n\nIt has been geographically specific: \n\nAdoption in the Americas is a pedestrian 10%. \n\nIn Europe and Australia, it's nearly double that. \n\nIn Asia and the Middle East, nearly 40% have one. \n\nIn India, EG, many PM job postings even ask for one! \n\nThis got me thinking... \n\nCould a great portfolio help distinguish candidates? \n\nSo, I recruited 5 interested mentees in my Slack community to work with me on a portfolio strategy. \n\nI'll be honest: we had lots of fits and starts along the way. \n\nPeople not reading the portfolios. \n\nPeople actually disliking the portfolios. \n\nOne mentee giving up on the strategy... \n\nBut, ultimately, we've been able to figure it out: \n\nA CS major got an APM gig. \n\nA principal PM finally broke into FAANG. \n\nAn aspiring PM finally secured their first PM role. \n\nA director of Product finally left a toxic manager. \n\nA PM laid off for 11 months got a job again. \n\nThe key? \n\nBuilding a differentiated portfolio that shows not just what you did, but how you did it. \n\nOf course, the portfolio doesn't do all the work. \n\nIt's one piece of the puzzle. \n\nBut in a world where so few use it, it can be a massive differentiator.\n"

Since the acquisition it's generated over 33k in revenue.\n\nHere's why I bought it \ud83d\udc47Acquiring SaaS products is a high risk endeavour. In order to drop that risk I look for specific characteristics in a deal.\n\nBelow are some of the items on my list:\n\n1. B2B --> I've learnt the hard way to avoid B2C\n\n1. Low churn --> Ideally below 3%. It could be as high as 5% if I believe I can drop it.\n\n1. At a minimum 50 paying customers --> Helps validate product-market fit.\n\n1. At least 10 paying customers who have paid for multiple years --> Helps validate product-market fit.\n\n1. No complicated industries --> This includes medical, space, biotech, etc.\n\n1. Simple, mature product --> I want something that does one thing extremely well. \n\nI don't want to have to pour a ton of R&D into the product post acquisition.\n\n1. Built in growth engine --> This is one of the hardest thing to find in a deal. \n\nI want to acquire something which is growing at least 10% a year organically either from strong existing SEO, virality, account expansion, etc.\n\n1. Low operational expenses (AKA high gross margin) --> Most SaaS cost very little to maintain. \n\nIt costs me less than $100 a month to run Meet Slack.\n\n1. Self service (AKA \"low support cost\") --> I don't want to have to run a large support team to assist users. \n\nThe product needs to be easy to use and require little to no account management.\n\n1. Clear way to grow revenue --> Either by investing in marketing, further product development, raising prices, or a combination of the above.\n\n1. 3 - 5X multiple on ARR --> I want to make my money back as soon as possible. \n\nLower churn, a higher ARPU and/or LTV, and the strength of the built in growth engine would increase the multiple.\n\nMeet Slack checks most of these boxes and will generate over $40k in revenue in 2024. This comes to around a 50% return on investment.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post and want to learn more about acquiring SaaS, and how to grow a holding company, then consider subscribing to my personal newsletter - https://lnkd.in/eUjEjjcz.\n"

      "full_template": "At the #StripeSessions conference this week they pointed out a huge shift that will change #CustomerSuccess dynamics forever. 82% of SaaS companies, in a survey conducted late last year, said they plan to or already do charge by usage.\n\nWhat does that mean as we shift from subscription revenue to transactional revenue? Sales will sell the right to do business, but CSMs will be responsible for generating the revenue.\n\nAfter all, if customers sign up but don't use it, the deal is worth $0. Comp plans should reflect this for both teams.\n\nCS performance and business contribution are most commonly measured by NRR or GRR - Recurring Revenue. Different KPIs are needed for goal setting and performance management when some or all of the revenue is transactional.\n\nTooling needs to improve in many cases to help CSMs not just understand how customers are using what they bought but to give insights into the rate of consumption relative to the potential. The more they use, the more they pay.\n\nSo the ROI has to be clearer because customers are fundamentally disincentivized from using your product unless they understand the value throughout the term, not just at renewal time. This shared risk model is better for customers but far less sticky for solution providers.\n\nForecasting can be challenging and CSMs will need better training in order to roll up accurate info for their leaders to manage financials.

Dramatically declaring you\u2019re going on a \u201cLinkedIn sabbatical/detox/cleanse\u201d, only to share 3 posts per day 2 days later.\n\n1. Solopreneurs dunking on FT employees. FT employees dunking on solopreneurs. Employers dunking on everyone.\n\nLike the term of your contract is suddenly a status symbol, sweet mother of Jesus.\n\n1. This one\u2019s for the ladies: The endless onslaught of unrelated selfies. \n\nI only learned to spell \u201cmoisturiser\u201d in my mid-thirties so I really, really can\u2019t beat you to this game.\n\n1. How you use ChatGPT to do every little thing nobody\u2019s interested in & can do 3 x faster without it.\n\n1. Dramatically announcing how you\u2019re going to be off for an entire eternity of 3.75 business days you\u2019ve frivolously decided to afford yourself for the first time in 5 years. \n\nAnd how you\u2019ll spend them on gobbling down lashings of pizza (accompanied by your size 0 selfie) with your numerous friends and family.\n\nBut you will be checking your DMs if it\u2019s _urgent_.\n\nAnd P.S. btw. you\u2019re accepting clients for 2024 - and you have only 2 slots left for your 1:1 discovery call for $297 per hour, and they are filling fast, babe!\n\n1. Saying that SEO is dead.\n\n1. Being rude and calling it \u201cpositioning\u201d.\n\n1. Telling everyone you\u2019ve earned my annual salary pre-tax on selling your ebook in 2 weeks, and then asking for free advice/contribution to your next one in DMs, or worse still - a $297 loan because \u201ceverybody knows it\u2019s been a hard year\u201d.\n\nWould be quite funny if it wasn\u2019t true.\n\n1. Posting unbacked \u201cstats\u201d and ignoring everyone who\u2019s calling you out in the comments.\n\n1. The Beckham meme. I _am_ being honest. It\u2019s like two months old now and memes have the longevity of a sandwich.\n\nTo a better tomorrow, fellow LinkedIn kids. \ud83e\udd42\n"

      "full_template": "5 Lessons for aspiring newsletter writers:\n\n1. Just get writing\n\nToo many people get hung up on their topic, their niche, and their unreasonably high quality bar. At first, your quality won't be great.\n\nYour content format will be wrong. But you can't improve either without publishing into the world.\n\nMy first format was company deep-dives. That's still something I do, but more like 6x per year - not 1x per week.\n\nThe initial posts seem like they were written by a dumber person with worse writing taste. I cringe when I read them.\n\nBut I needed those reps to cringe less now.\n\n1. Find your tribe\n\nOne of the biggest life hacks across any domain is to get a peer group. I have myself mine - several chat groups of newsletter writers in similar niches.\n\nThese groups are great for understanding I'm not alone. We all get flamed on Reddit.\n\nThey're also great for encouraging me to do what I need to. I would have never monetized the newsletter and gone full-time without the suggestion of Pawel Huryn, for instance.\n\n\"You are the sum of the people closest to you.\" Your tribe makes you who you are.\n\n1. Keep raising the quality bar\n\nAs you get to writing, you should read your old writing regularly. If you can't read it, no one else will.\n\nEverytime I get bored of one of my own pieces and check my phone... I'm happy! Now I know where the readers are dropping off.\n\nMake sure every post you make is better than the last in some way. Publishing is fine and dandy.\n\nBut worthless if you keep making the same mistakes. I've met some writers with 100+ editions and <10K subscribers.\n\nIf that's the case, you need to refine your quality.\n\n1. Write for you\n\nIt's really easy to just follow the market or follow the trends. Certainly, I've made this mistake many times.\n\nRegrettable web3 pieces? Check\n\nOverhyped AI takes? Check\n\nCringe hooks? Check\n\nBut I've been decreasing their frequency. The question I ask myself is: Would I like this myself?\n\nThe skeptical version of me that didn't like newsletters three years ago. The one who thought he was super smart already.\n\nWriting for this past version of me is my crucial check now.\n\n1. Don't abandon the publishing schedule\n\nThe dichotomy of writing is you must continuously raise the bar and write for yourself, but... You need to keep up a regular publishing schedule.\n\nYou can't go full YouTube and go from daily uploading to monthly uploading. Publishing regularly isn't just for your readers, it's also for yourself.\n\nThe job of newsletter writer is an incredibly tough one. And continuously improving gets harder over time.\n\nYou need to assign yourself artificial publishing deadlines to actually push stuff out.\n\nP.S. Want to go deeper? \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gbt3Hk2X\n\n--SUMMARY\n\nHow to grow your newsletter to 90K:\n\n1. Just get writing\n\n1. Create a peer group\n\n1. Keep raising the quality bar\n\n1. Write for you, not for the market\n\n1. Don't abandon the publishing schedule\n"

Schedule one Think Day per quarter. \n\nSpend the entire day thinking. \n\n1. Turn on Grayscale Mode on your phone to improve your focus. \n\n1. To improve at anything, use my 30-for-30 approach. \n\nDo it for 30 minutes per day for 30 straight days. \n\n1. Set labeled alarms on your phone that remind you of the character you need to embody at specific times of day. \n\n1. Color code your calendar according to whether activities were energy creating (green), neutral (yellow), or energy draining (red). \n\nPrioritize energy creating activities and slowly eliminate energy draining activities. \n\n1. Spend more time around the big thinkers in your circle. \n\n1. Set ABC goals for any daily endeavor. \n\nA is your best case, B is your base case, and C is your downside case. \n\nAnything above 0 compounds. \n\n1. Develop a fixed \"power down ritual\" to mark the end of your professional day. \n\n1. Build a deep work practice by blocking 60-minute windows during which you have zero email, messaging, apps, or distractions. \n\n1. Default to 25-minute calls/meetings and take a simple walk during the 5 minutes. \n\n1. Use the Feynman Technique for learning anything new. \n\nIdentify a topic, try to explain it to a 5-year-old, study to fill in knowledge gaps. \n\n1. Default to no. \n\nIf you wouldn't want to do the thing today, don't say yes to doing it a month from now. \n\n1. Use an Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize your tasks. \n\nThe goal is to spend more time on important tasks that further your long-term goals. \n\n1. Batch email and message processing into 1-3 condensed windows during the day. \n\n1. Take a 15-minute tech free walk every single morning. \n\n1. Follow the 80% rule to fight the afternoon lull. \n\nEat to 80% full at lunch and take a short walk to improve mental clarity. \n\n1. To feel energized in the morning, try my 5-5-5-30 Method. \n\nWhen you wake up, do 5 push-ups, 5 squats, 5 lunges, and a 30-second plank. \n\n1. Get cold more often. \n\n11 minutes of weekly cold water immersion has been shown to create immediate physical and mental benefits. \n\n1. If you're struggling to fall asleep, try the 4-7-8 Method. \n\nBreathe in through your nose for a 4-second count, hold your breath for a 7-second count, and exhale for an 8-second count. \n\n1. Do all of your shopping on the outer perimeter of the grocery store. \n\n1. Create an auto direct deposit for a small amount of money into an investment account every month. \n\n1. Automate all simple financial tasks such as paying bills, credit cards, and investing. \n\n1. Make a rule to wait 48 hours before completing any non-essential material purchase. \n\n1. Simplify your life by removing anything that doesn't feel (a) necessary and (b) energy creating. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Enjoy this?

      "full_template": "Conventional wisdom suggests Expansion ARR should be around 30% of total New/Growth ARR. Is that true today and at what stage of growth?\n\nThe answer is it depends - especially on your stage of growth as measured by company revenue. New Go-to-Market motions (PLG) and pricing models (Usage-Based Pricing) are purpose-built to decrease initial customer acquisition friction.\n\nThis, in turn, \"should\" increase expansion ARR as a % of total New/Growth ARR. Based on company size, below are the latest benchmarks on the % of total new growth revenue (ARR) delivered by existing customer expansion:\n\n< $5M = 25% (median)\n\n$5M - $20M = 34% (median)\n\n$20M - $50M = 42% (median)\n\n$50M - $100M = 45% (median)\n\nTotal Population = 33% at median (N = 516)\n\nSome very interesting findings include: \n\nSales-Led Growth models had a higher % of Expansion than PLG models. Note this did not factor in Usage-Based Pricing as a variable.\n\nACV was an important factor in the benchmark findings. \n\nMeasuring \"WHEN\" new ARR ends and expansion ARR begins is a critical variable in calculating several associated metrics beyond expansion ARR %:\n\n- CAC Ratio\n\n- CAC Payback Period\n\n- Net Dollar Retention (Net Revenue Retention)\n\nExpansion ARR as a percentage of total new/growth revenue was the topic of the first episode of SaaS Talk. This is a great listen for anyone considering how to increase expansion ARR and how to measure its financial impact, including revenue growth efficiency.\n\nIf you want to see how Expansion ARR % is impacted by company variables similar to yours, SaaS Benchmarks (with an .ai extension) has the info. \n\n#b2bsaas #benchmarks #metrics\n"

It\u2019s for \u201cpay once\u201d software (formerly known as plain old software.)\n\nWhile the idea of owning, instead of subscribing to, software isn\u2019t new, what Jason Fried at 37signals has done here is some perfectly timed business genius. Because it makes a 60-year-old category sound like a revolution.\n\nOn the heels of B2B SaaS bloat and growing customer frustration over the last 5 years\u2014and a downturn in the economy\u2014Fried came in and proposed a new way: Why pay subscription fees forever when you can pay once and own your software instead? Here\u2019s a bit from their pitch-perfect POV: \n\n\u201cFor nearly two decades, the SaaS model benefitted landlords handsomely. With routine prayers \u2014 and payers \u2014 to the Church of Recurring Revenue, valuations shot to the moon on the backs of businesses subscribed at luxury prices for commodity services they had little control over. \n\nAdd up your SaaS subscriptions last year. You should own that shit by now.\u201d \n\nTheir first \u201cpay once\u201d product is Campfire, a Slack competitor. Dozens of Slack competitors have failed over the years. \n\nWhy? Because, once established, it\u2019s almost impossible to overtake a category leader. \n\nSo 37 Signals competed with Slack by being something Slack could never be. That\u2019s the definition of great strategy. \n\nZig when they zag. Be strong where they're weak. \n\nAnother smart thing 37 Signals did. They used what I call the three levers of differentiation: \n\n- Business model\n- Product\n- Marketing.\n\nBy differentiating in all three dimensions, their customer is way more likely to consider their pitch. \n\nHere\u2019s how they differentiated in each area: \n\nBusiness Model \u21b3 Pay once instead of forever. \n\nProduct \u21b3 Campfire: simple, no-BS business messaging. Like Slack without all the feature creep (and you own it). \n\nMarketing \u21b3 Direct, honest, founder-led marketing. \n\nBecause they have these three levers working together, it gives way more credibility to the idea that Campfire is categorically different than Slack. \n\nThat \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude26 is what makes customers pay attention to their pitch. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that some Slack customers could save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by switching to Campfire. \n\nThat\u2019s a pretty good pitch. \n\nStill, a small software company competing with Salesforce and Microsoft usually ends badly. \n\nDo you think they\u2019ll succeed?

Maja Voje and I studied 12 leading B2B SaaS companies. \n\n(Including interviews with their teams) Here's what we learned: PLG is eating the world. \n\n80% of the companies in our study employ PLG in some fashion. \n\nEven enterprise companies like Snowflake and Salesforce are adding free trials & freemium.\n\nIt's the new normal. \n\nWhy is this working for them? \n\nIn 2024, the best marketing is often your product. \n\nUsers rarely want to lock in a $500K+ contract without trying the product first. \n\nBut you do need to layer on a strong product-led sales motion to make enterprise work. \n\nDominate one at first, then layer on many. \n\nEvery company we studied got one GTM motion massively right. \n\nAnd, in each case, they still use that GTM motion in some form today. \n\nBut, they layer on other motions over time. \n\nThe ideal way to layer is symbiotically: \n\nABM couples nicely with outbound. \n\nInbound supports outbound. \n\nPartnerships amplify PLG. \n\nFor instance: Dropbox grew at first massively on referrals. \n\nNow, other channels are much more important. \n\nABM and Outbound are pillars of enterprise. \n\nFor 5- and 6-figure deals, it's difficult to rely on inbound or PLG alone. \n\nThe buyer is used to a different process. \n\nThey want to be hand-held. \n\nThis is where motions like ABM and outbound shine. \n\nThat's why you still see the Snowflake's and Salesforce's of the world focusing on them. \n\nThey're the bread and butter of enterprise. \n\nSo\u2026 bringing it all together, here's where to start based on your buyer. \n\nIf you're selling to consumers or prosumers: \n\nLean into PLG, community, and partnerships early on. \n\nLayer in paid marketing as you find product-market fit and have budget to scale. \n\nIf you're selling to SMBs: \n\nBlend inbound and outbound motions to build awareness and relationships. \n\nPaid digital can accelerate pipeline generation as you dial in your ICP. \n\nIf you're selling to enterprises: \n\nFocus on targeted ABM and partner ecosystems. \n\nInbound is great for air cover, but outbound is crucial for landing large accounts. \n\nIf you have a complex or technical product: \n\nMake sure you have developer docs, free tooling, and community support from day one. \n\nDon't underrate channels like partnerships & paid digital; they can still be crucial support. \n\nAnd above all: \n\nRemember what works at one stage may not work another. \n\nRemember the law of diminishing returns. \n\nBe willing to pivot when necessary.\n"

He would seclude himself in a remote location, close all communication, and spend an entire week dedicated to reading, learning, and thinking.\n\nThe radical approach became a core part of his process: \"Think Week is a time when I can be creative and push my own thinking. It's a time to step outside the day-to-day demands of my job and really focus on the big picture.\" - Bill Gates\n\nI first read about the Think Week years ago and immediately knew I wanted to give it a shot. I knew I didn't have an entire week to dedicate to it (early career demands, family priorities, etc.), but I figured I could adapt something with a similar vision.\n\nThe Think Day was my creation:  \nPick one day each month (or quarter) to step back from your day-to-day professional demands.  \n\n\u2022 Seclude yourself (mentally or physically)  \n\n\u2022 Shut off notifications on your devices  \n\n\u2022 Put up an out-of-office response  \n\nThe goal is to create space to spend the entire day reading, learning, journaling, and THINKING. By doing this, you create the free time to zoom out, open your mind, and think creatively about the bigger picture.\n\nMy essential tools for the Think Day:  \n\u2022 Journal and pen  \n\n\u2022 Books/articles I've been wanting to read  \n\n\u2022 Secluded location (at home, Airbnb, or outside)  \n\n\u2022 Thinking question prompts to spark my mind  \n\n6 thinking question prompts I've found useful:  \n\n1. How can you do less, but better?  \n\n1. Are you hunting antelope (big important problems) or field mice (small urgent problems)?  \n\n1. What are your strongest beliefs? What would it take for you to change your mind on them?  \n\n1. What are a few things that you know now that you wish you knew 5 years ago?  \n\n1. What actions were you engaged in 5 years ago that you cringe at today? What actions are you engaged in today that you will cringe at in 5 years?  \n\n1. What would your 80-year-old self say about your decisions today?  \n\nI aim for an 8-hour window (typical 9-5 day) split into 60-minute focus blocks with walks in between. The walks open your mind to more creative thinking (don't neglect them!).\n\nYou have to slow down to speed up. In a world obsessed with speed, the benefits of slowing down are extensive:  \n\n\u2022 Restore energy  \n\n\u2022 Notice things you missed  \n\n\u2022 Be more deliberate with action  \n\n\u2022 Focus on the highest leverage opportunities  \n\nThe Think Day can be a secret weapon for you in 2024. Give it a shot and let me know what you think.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Enjoy this?

      "full_template": "For a company founded in '93, Nvidia's ascent to $2.7T market cap has been FAST. But what really is Nvidia's moat? Let's break it down.\n\nPART 1 \u2014 SOFTWARE\n\nThe story starts all the way back in the early 2000s. That's when Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, and his team were out meeting researchers using their products.\n\nMost researchers were hacking graphics packages to run complex parallel compute tasks. It was not ideal. \n\nTo say the least. So, when the Nvidia team met Ian Buck, who had the vision of running general purpose programming languages on GPUs, they funded his Ph.D. \n\nAfter graduation, Ian came to Nvidia to commercialize the tech. Two years later, in 2006, Nvidia released CUDA.\n\nCompute Unified Device Architecture. CUDA made all those parallelization hacks the researchers were doing available to everyone.\n\nOver time, CUDA became the default choice for researchers. CUDA allowed accessible customization of the low-level hardware.\n\nSo developers loved it. Nowadays, when startups like MosaicML evaluate the available technology vs CUDA, they inevitably choose CUDA.\n\nThe ecosystem around CUDA has grown so robust that its lead is virtually unbeatable. This software layer is at the core of Nvidia's moat.\n\nPART 2 \u2014 HARDWARE\n\nThe other side of Nvidia's moat is hardware. But it's not graphics cards for crypto and gaming.\n\nThe hardware that matters is AI supercomputers. The story of these supercomputers begins in the late 2000s. \n\nAs Nvidia was developing CUDA, Jensen asked the team to build a supercomputer to help him build better chips. The result was a massive supercomputer that weighed 100 pounds and strung together many GPUs with world-class networking for ultra-fast computing.\n\nIn the early 2010s, Jensen gave a talk at a conference about this AI supercomputer. Elon Musk got wind of it and said, \"I want one.\" \n\nSo, in 2016, Jensen actually donated one to Elon Musk's relatively unknown nonprofit, OpenAI. He hand delivered it, and there's photographic proof.\n\nOpenAI quickly learned the supercomputer worked really well. Especially for training large neural networks. \n\nThat 2016 Pascal architecture delivered an impressive 19 TFLOPS of FP16 operations. That's 19 trillion floating point operations per second. \n\nIt's a massive amount. But that was just the beginning.\n\nSince then, Jensen and the Nvidia team have been lapping the industry in delivering more TFLOPS, growing them at an exponential rate. \n\nThe latest Blackwell architecture delivers a massive 5000 TFLOPS. That's >260x AI computer in 8 years.\n\nAnd it sells for more than $75K. But buyers like Meta, OpenAI, Google, and Amazon just can't get enough, as their internal ASICs are nowhere near Nvidia's level.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's profits and market cap continue to soar, cementing its position as a leader in the AI hardware and software space.\n"

But the graveyard is vast. \n\nHere's what not to do: Spencer Shulem and I studied dozens of AI startup failures and successes. This is what we learned: \n\nFalling for shiny object syndrome. When a shiny new model or tech drops, it's tempting to pursue it. \n\nFor example, Argo AI raised billions of dollars to build self-driving tech. But after 6 years, the company realized the tech wasn't ready for public roads. \n\nNow, it's gone. Successful startups stay laser-focused on their target user and use case. \n\nFor example, Anthropic has been working on its constitutional AI technology for years, despite many flashy new approaches emerging. \n\nThat focus allowed them to make (one of) the best LLM(s) out there. \n\n\"It works in the lab.\" Turning prototypes into products takes massive investments. \n\nDon't make the Rabbit/Humane mistake: they had good demos and commercials, but the AI devices didn't live up to the hype in the real world. \n\nNow, both are headed to the graveyard. Successful AI startups make demos replicable in reality. \n\nFor instance, Cohere spent two years building a robust serving platform. \n\nThis foundational work enabled their self-serve API to reliably handle billions of requests from day 1. \n\nIrresponsible deployment. In the rush to market, many AI product teams fail to put adequate safeguards in place. \n\nTake Clearview AI. They scraped hundreds of millions of social media photos without consent. \n\nWhen the NYT exposed it, they got banned from selling to companies and folded. \n\nOn the other hand, teams like those at Perplexity AI pay especially close attention to Red Teaming. \n\nTheir vigilance has allowed them to take share from Google, whose AI search has myriad examples of irresponsible outputs (like recommending the depressed to jump off a bridge). \n\nPrioritizing flash over function. Many failed AI startups churn out flashy demos that generate reams of press, but don't solve real problems. \n\nRemember Quixey? Their demos touted a deep learning-powered \"search engine for apps.\" \n\nNow, they don't exist. Successful startups like video AI tool Runway laser-focused on their users' gnarliest problems. \n\nThey went deep on discovery with video creators to find the workflows that burn hours and dollars. \n\nThen, they cut the time & cost by 10x. \n\nRaising too much, too fast. VC can seem necessary as an AI founder. \n\nBut have you heard the stories of Olive AI or Inflection? Each raised a billion or more without achieving product-market fit. \n\nNow, they barely exist. On the other hand, successful startups like Cohere bootstrapped for 2 years before raising a $40M Series A. \n\nThis allowed them to deeply validate their self-serve model and hit $1M ARR before taking on VC. \n\nWith strong fundamentals in place, they could then scale with confidence.\n"

          "full_content": "AI Product Management\n\nAI Product Management is evolving rapidly. The growth of generative AI and AI-based developer tools has created numerous opportunities to build AI applications. This is making it possible to build new kinds of things, which in turn is driving shifts in best practices in product management \u2014 the discipline of defining what to build to serve users \u2014 because what is possible to build has shifted. In this post, I\u2019ll share some best practices I have noticed.\n\nUse concrete examples to specify AI products. Starting with a concrete idea helps teams gain speed. If a product manager (PM) proposes to build \u201ca chatbot to answer banking inquiries that relate to user accounts,\u201d this is a vague specification that leaves much to the imagination. For instance, should the chatbot answer questions only about account balances or also about interest rates, processes for initiating a wire transfer, and so on? But if the PM writes out a number (say, between 10 and 50) of concrete examples of conversations they\u2019d like a chatbot to execute, the scope of their proposal becomes much clearer. Just as a machine learning algorithm needs training examples to learn from, an AI product development team needs concrete examples of what we want an AI system to do. In other words, the data is your PRD (product requirements document)!\n\nIn a similar vein, if someone requests \u201ca vision system to detect pedestrians outside our store,\u201d it\u2019s hard for a developer to understand the boundary conditions. Is the system expected to work at night? What is the range of permissible camera angles? Is it expected to detect pedestrians who appear in the image even though they\u2019re 100m away? But if the PM collects a handful of pictures and annotates them with the desired output, the meaning of \u201cdetect pedestrians\u201d becomes concrete. An engineer can assess if the specification is technically feasible and if so, build toward it. Initially, the data might be obtained via a one-off, scrappy process, such as the PM walking around taking pictures and annotating them. Eventually, the data mix will shift to real-word data collected by a system running in production.\n\nUsing examples (such as inputs and desired outputs) to specify a product has been helpful for many years, but the explosion of possible AI applications is creating a need for more product managers to learn this practice.\n\nAssess technical feasibility of LLM-based applications by prompting. When a PM scopes out a potential AI application, whether the application can actually be built \u2014 that is, its technical feasibility \u2014 is a key criterion in deciding what to do next. For many ideas for LLM-based applications, it\u2019s increasingly possible for a PM, who might not be a software engineer, to try prompting \u2014 or write just small amounts of code \u2014 to get an initial sense of feasibility.\n\n[Reached length limit.

          "full_content": "Time to play! Build an interactive game from scratch with LLMs in this new short course: Building an AI-Powered Game. Created with Together AI and AI Dungeon/Latitude, taught by Niki Birkner, Senior Product Manager at Together AI, and Nick Walton, CEO and Co-Founder of Latitude.\n\nThis course shows you how to use large language models to create and power a text-based game that you can share with your friends and family. You\u2019ll build a world with hierarchical content generation, a method that allows you to leverage LLMs to create a vast amount of content with a high level of control and consistency. For instance, if you were building a fantasy world with several kingdoms, in which each kingdom has multiple towns, and each town has several locations and residents, creating all this content from scratch can easily become tedious and difficult to track.\n\nWith hierarchical content generation, you can create information about your world, shape its direction with a human-in-the-loop, and keep it consistent, with little effort based on your prompts.\n\nBy the end of this course, you\u2019ll know how to prompt engineer to create a layered and interwoven world and integrate it into an AI roleplay game that is interesting, interactive, and safe to share with anyone. \n\nIn detail, you\u2019ll:\u00a0\n- Learn to implement game mechanics using AI to parse text data into structured JSON output, enabling features like an inventory system.\n- Use game mechanics with story and state components that feed into one another to improve your game's memory, and gives the player a steady state of the world.\n- Learn to enforce safety and compliance for AI content generation and create custom policies using Llama Guard.\n\nWith these techniques, you'll be equipped to build AI-powered applications, starting with your own game.\n\nPlease sign up here:\u00a0 https://lnkd.in/gwwkVUwj",

Why?\n\nI think we could have done so much better. \n\nWhy?\n\n1. We identified the \u201cfiltering, routing, and what now\u201d problems 5mo in, but\u00a0\n2. Didn\u2019t start making real moves to solve them until around a month ago.\n\nAs a result, our churn rate has been a source of great frustration and disappointment.\n\nHere are the four biggest mistakes I think we made over the past four months:\u00a0 \n\n- We JUST built the Salesforce integration for our larger prospects\n- We JUST rebuilt our Hubspot integration to filter, route, alert, add to lead score, and start automations within the CRM\n- We STILL have not teed up suggested messages using AI (the \u201cwhat now\u201d?)\n- I ROYALLY screwed up our pricing on launch, and cost us 2mo of growth\n\nIf I had to do it all over again I would have done things sooo differently.\n\nBut that's almost the case in startup-land.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHaving said all that... \n\nI\u2019m very optimistic that we can hit $10m ARR in the next 12mo.\n\nEven though $10m will be MUCH harder than $5m because of our high churn.\n\nWhat are our plans for the next 12mo? \n\n1. Add worldwide, company-level ID, partnered with DemandBase\n2. Add a job change signal (and then others)\n3. Resolve the \u201cwhat now\u201d problem using AI\n\nStrategically, we want to try to get reps valuable signals with the simplest possible delivery, WITHOUT having to adopt a new platform, at a great price.\n\nWe think we can do most of what needs to be done in the CRM\u2026 \n\nFor a HIGH percentage of the workflows our competitors accomplish in their platforms.\n\nAnd we think that NOT adopting a platform is very attractive to a large part of the market.\n\nI have no idea if this is the right move\u2026 \n\nAnd it\u2019s certainly going the opposite direction of anyone doing anything like us.\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing that makes me the most excited about it. \n\nStupid Simple Sales Signals. \n\nIt has a nice ring to it.",

          "full_content": "If you want to acquire a million-dollar company, you don\u2019t need to have millions.\n\nHere\u2019s how to buy a business that pays for itself (9 negotiation tips for seller financing):\n\nFirst up, seller financing means you agree to pay the seller back over time directly using the profits of the business.\n\nWhy would you want to do such a thing?\n\n2 main reasons:\n\n\u2022 You pay less out of pocket, without needing bank approval.\n\u2022 The seller keeps skin in the game. It's now in their best interest to give you a business that will continue to profit.\n\nSounds great as a buyer, but why would a seller ever say yes to this?\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s faster than bank loans\n\u2022 They can ask for a higher price\n\u2022 They pocket interest, instead of the bank\n\u2022 Tax payments get dispersed\n\nBut there are some hurdles to seller financing:\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s harder than applying for a bank loan\n\u2022 Sellers need to be \u201csold\u201d on it\n\u2022 Many sellers will still say no\n\nSo let\u2019s look at 9 ways to increase your odds of seller financing a deal:\n\n1. ALWAYS ASK.\n\nSeller financing isn\u2019t all or nothing. ALWAYS feel out how much the seller will finance. Maybe you only get $300k on a $3M deal. That's $300k not out of YOUR pocket.\n\n2. Relationship Is the Foundation\n\nYour odds of getting financing increase as your rapport with the seller increases.\n\n3. Seller Risk\n\nYou\u2019ll get pushback. Get to the bottom of WHY the seller is hesitant. It\u2019s often not a no, just an \u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d Find out what will make them sure.\n\n4. Your Price, My Terms\n\nSeller wants $250k more for the biz? Alright, then you the buyer get to hold the reigns on the interest rate, length of payback period, and other levers.\n\n5. Presentation\n\nYou are PITCHING a seller, so go back to negotiation 101:\n\u2022 Don\u2019t play all your cards at once\n\u2022 Focus on where the seller\u2019s head is at & what they need to move the deal forward\n\n6. Throwaway Terms\n\nThe seller\u2019s mind is running through worst case scenarios. Most of those scenarios have a .0001% chance of happening, so you can put them in the contract anyway.\n\n7. Fallback Positions\n\nThese are backup terms you don\u2019t want to lead with, but would compromise for.\n\n8. Knowledge vs Wisdom\n\nKeep rebuttals to seller concerns in your back pocket. But don\u2019t just rattle off a bunch of terms and benefits. Understand their fear/concern \u2192 then propose the solution for it\n\n9. Creative Solutions\n\nEvery deal is full of problems.

They have massive teams, expensive infrastructure, and shareholders demanding consistent growth.\n\nAnd more people than ever want to use these products, but they don't want to pay another monthly subscription. \n\nMeanwhile, a small team of vibe coders could band together tomorrow and build 90%+ of the functionality in weeks, not years and offer it for FREE to 99% of users. Thanks to tools like Replit, V0, Cursor, Bolt, Lovable etc and all these open-source models.\n\nAnd instead of charging monthly, you give it out for free, and charge power users per outcome. And you can layer on premium service to cash flow (I can talk about that on another tweet on what I'd do)\n\nWhat's holding people back? Is it the fear of taking on giants? The allure of building something \"new\" instead of \"better\"? Or people just like building on their own so they don't want to band together?\n\nI think the avg customer prefers a one-stop shop for all these free new AI saas powered tools. \n\nYou don't need to raise VC if you don't want to. \n\nEvery time I open one of these legacy products and see the same old interfaces with the same old limitations, I can't help but think we're at the beginning of a massive wealth transfer from incumbents to the teams bold enough to rebuild them from scratch.\n\nI'm not saying these incumbents are going to die btw. But I do think there's an opportunity (yeah a really big one) to peel off some of their sweet saas revenue and monetize it differently. Make it free for most. \n\nNothing people hate more than a monthly subscription. \n\nHappy building.\n\ni've shared 30+ more startup ideas you can steal here https://lnkd.in/dGt8Cch4",

I heard this for years.\n\nI get it. Running an agency is brutal. You're LUCKY to hit 15% margins after paying employees, rent etc. \n\nMost agency founders spend their Sundays dreading Monday's personnel issues.\n\nbut I'm watching something fascinating emerge in 2025 and i wanted to share it with you. \n\nAI agents aren't perfect yet. but the writing is on the wall: what currently takes 50 people will soon be done by 2 people orchestrating 50 AI workers. \n\nsame revenue, but margins jump from 20% to 80%. no overhead, no drama, pure profit. clients pay less, get faster work.\n\non the outside, nothing will change. same agency, same deliverables. but on the inside,  pure sweet software margins. yum.\n\ni wouldnt be surprised if suddenly silicon valley liked the agency business. just a way to learn a workflow, automate, build a cash-machine and invest that into tech that makes the whole machine work smoother.\n\nme and my holdco (we've got a few agencies) will invest millions of dollars into this. putting our money where our mouth is.\n\nturns out agencies were just one letter off - they're becoming agent-cies.\n\nthis wave is coming fast.\n\nfor 30+ startup ideas i love (some AI ones), grab them for free at https://lnkd.in/eKicBBqe \n\nor 6 tools i use to validate business ideas here https://lnkd.in/eR_kjAWP",

          "full_content": "Are we going to pretend $750/hour law firms are going to be business as usual in the AI age?\n\nI just used Grok Deep Research to draft a simple contract. Took 15 minutes. Would have cost $2,000 with a lawyer. \n\nWhen I sent it to my attorney to review, his response was \"looks good\" 2 days later.\n\nI had already sent the contract lol. It was signed by the client. Thanks Mr. Attorney.\n\nLawyers and accountants keep insisting that AI is just a toy and real work requires human judgment. Meanwhile, their billable hours model is silently imploding.\n\nI've watched this pattern play out before. First comes denial. Then \"it only works for simple stuff.\" Then \"it can't handle nuance.\" Finally, massive restructuring.\n\nLaw firms won't disappear, but the pyramid of junior associates doing document review and contract drafting is evaporating overnight. What nobody's talking about is how the next generation will learn when the entry-level jobs that have always been the training ground are precisely what AI does best.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the biggest shock to law firms comes when their own clients start bringing AI-drafted documents to meetings and just asking for quick reviews. \n\nThe real change won't be dramatic - it'll be the slow realization that clients are paying for 1 hour of work instead of 10, while still getting the same outcome. \n\nIt'll be death by a thousand cuts as more routine legal work gets handled by in-house teams with AI assistance.\n\nWe're watching the complete reinvention of professional services happen in real-time, and pretending nothing will change.",

Write effective hooks\n\nYour hook\u2014the first 10% of your post\u2014decides whether or not people read the last 90% of it.\n\nLike it or not, you\u2019re competing for attention.\n\nIf your hook isn\u2019t interesting, your readers will scroll to something more interesting.\n\n2. Be consistent\n\nPublishing content on LinkedIn consistently is the price of entry\u2014you can\u2019t succeed without it.\n\nThat said, consistency isn\u2019t enough by itself.\n\nYour target needs to be undeniably valuable to a clearly defined target audience who can pay for more of your knowledge.\n\nInterview your target market to learn their pain points. Then, build content pillars around each of those pain points.\n\nResults are inevitable.\n\n3. Respond to your comments\n\nLinkedIn values community much more than any other social media platform\u2014\n\nThis means they want to see authors engaging with their audience (and other industry peers).\n\nCreators who take the time to respond won\u2019t just enjoy greater reach, but deeper audience connections, too.\n\n4. Experiment with different formats\n\nFor most authors, written posts aren\u2019t enough to make the most of LinkedIn anymore\u2026\n\nCarousels tend to get the most reach, while video creates the deepest psychological connections.\n\n(There\u2019s also some evidence LinkedIn is pushing videos more in the feed than it used to)\n\n5. Write for your target audience\n\nStop trying to \u201cgo viral\u201d and \u201cgo value\u201d instead.\n\n10,000,000 views from total strangers are worthless if they\u2019re not interested in your actual expertise as a professional\u2026\n\nSure, a few of them may hit the follow button, but they won\u2019t stick around if you\u2019re just another \u201cinfluencer\u201d handing out dopamine hits.\n\nThe real winners on LinkedIn focus on audience quality.\n\nAll it takes is the right impression on the right people to create high-paying clients (and life-changing results).\n\nThose are some of my favorite \u201cbasic\u201d LinkedIn tips\u2014\n\nWhat are yours?",

The Success-Only Trap\n\nThey look only at what worked, never what failed.\n\nIt\u2019s like studying only lottery winners to understand how to win the lottery.\n\n2. The False Attribution Trap\n\nThey attribute success to things they can control instead of what matters:\n\nSaying something worth paying attention to.\n\n3. The Correlation Confusion\n\nThey mistake correlation for causation.\n\nJust because something happened before success doesn\u2019t mean it caused success.\n\nAnd the truth is, the content format doesn\u2019t matter (much).\n\nWhat drives actual LinkedIn success is\u2026\n\n1. Credibility (Do people trust your expertise?)\n2. Value (Are you saying something worth hearing?)\n3. Clarity (Can people understand your point quickly?)\n4. Luck (Will the algorithm pick it up? Will it show it to the right audience?)\n\nEverything else is just optimization.\n\nI\u2019ve seen too many people chase vanity metrics that lead to zero business results.\n\nBelow, I break down the metrics that matter and how to build real LinkedIn success.\n\nRead my complete guide for the full breakdown on how to cut through the \u201cLinkedIn noise\u201d:\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dJb_ZwSG",

If I don\u2019t throw the starfish back in, they\u2019ll die.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head and said, \"But there's too many starfish on this beach. You can\u2019t possibly make a difference.\"\n\nAfter thinking for a moment, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it into the ocean.\n\nThen, he turned to the old man and said, \"Well, I made a difference to that one.\"\n\nIn your own life and career, it's easy to adopt a negative mindset in the face of a seemingly enormous challenge.\n\nYou're trying to transform your life, but it's impossible to see how the tiny actions today will ever create the change you seek.\n\nIn those moments, remember the little boy from the story:\n\nBend down, pick up a single starfish, and throw it back into the ocean.\n\nYou won't change your life in a day, but if you change your days, you'll eventually change your life.\n\nMy book offers a guide to the tiny actions you can start taking to change your days, so that you can eventually change your life.\n\nIt comes out in exactly one month. Andrew Huberman called it \"An important clarifying force in anyone\u2019s search to make the best possible choices for their life,\u00a0and to experience the greatest amount of joy and fulfillment along the way.\"\n\nOrder here: https://lnkd.in/efUWCNW9",

          "full_content": "Subject lines are the hardest type of \"hook\" to write. So I created an AI prompt that makes it 10x easier:\n\nBut first, why is writing great subject lines so hard?\n\nSimple:\n\nBecause you have a such big \u201clength\u201d constraint.\n\n(For context: Ideally, a subject line can only have 40-45 characters.)\n\nAnd the more concise you have to be, the harder it is to write something good - and the more thought it requires.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s 2 \u201chacks\u201d that can make it 10x easier to write a potent subject line:\n\n\u2022 Starting with an already proven hook (so you don\u2019t need to start \u201cfrom scratch)\n\n\u2022 Using an AI tool like Claude or ChatGPT to accelerate your \u201cbrainstorming\u201d process (so you can find the best formats & angles, faster)\n\nSo with this in mind, I created a plug-and-play AI prompt to help you write irresistible subject lines - 10x faster!\n\nAll you need?\n\nA proven Twitter/X or LinkedIn hook.\n\nIt can be yours or it can be someone else\u2019s.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve found it, all you need to do is fill in the prompt below & feed it to your favorite AI tool.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n\"You\u2019re a world-class email copywriter. I want your help turning a viral LinkedIn hook I recently found into an attention-grabbing subject line.\n\nSo, here's what we're going to do:\n\nI'm going to share with you the LinkedIn hook and then I want you to come up with 15 different subject line variations inspired by that hook.\n\nNow, here are a few important guidelines you should follow when brainstorming each subject line variation:\n\n\u2022 The subject line shouldn't have more than 45 characters (including spaces)\n\n\u2022 The subject line needs to be clear (not clever) but also create a \"curiosity gap\" (i.e. We can't give the reader the \"answer.\" Instead we need to give them a reason to want to open the email.)\n\n\u2022 The subject line should be formatted in sentence case (never capitalize the first letter of each word because we don't want our subject lines to read like an article headline).\n\n\u2022 For each subject line variation we come up with, we also need to generate a \"preview text.\" (For context: the \"preview text\" is the copy that shows up right next to or underneath the email subject line on people's inbox, and it acts almost a sub-headline.)\n\n\u2022 The preview text should *complement* NOT repeat the same idea that's being communicated in the subject line. We also want to avoid repeating any words that have already been used in the headline. (Again, we want to use the \"preview text\" as a sub-headline.)\n\n\u2022 Lastly, please structure your output in the following way:\n\n[Heading] Subject Line X\n\n\u2022 Subject line: [insert subject line variation]\n\u2022 Preview text: [insert preview text variation]\n\nSo here you go - here's my LinkedIn hook:\"\n\nPS - Want to get this prompt in a Notion doc?\n\nComment \"prompt\" and I'll send it over (along with another bonus prompt).",

          "full_content": "Why Startup Founders Fail: \n\n(based on my own failures & 100+ founders in my network)\n\n1. Solution looking for a problem.\nFounders build a solution first and then go to users, pitching it and trying to convince them they have such a problem.\n\n2. They like it, but won't pay.\nOften happens to \"vitamin\" products.\n\n3. Failed to monetize b2c.\nOnce, I built an app with over 100k users, and was 1st on App Store with an award. But once I wanted to monetize it, I realized it was impossible to make good money here. \n\n4. Raised VC money for a non-unicorn idea.\nVCs make 100 bets. You're just one of 100. The chance you fail is 99%, because for VCs anything is a failure except unicorns.\nYou could turn it into $10m/year biz in a bootstrapped mode, but VCs will force u to bankrupt such company.\n\n\n5. Wrong cofounder.\nWhen 2 people start a company, and 1 quits, the other one isn't that crazy about working their ass off for this startup to succeed.\nMost startups I know that lost one of their cofounders early failed. I think cofounders bring more risk than upside.\n\n6. Small market.\nIn Norway, where I spent most of my life building my startups, most would first start with a local market.\nI thought it was smart, but the aftermath of the last 15 years shows that it was the reason for the downfall of the Norwegian startup ecosystem.\n\n7. Outsourcing.\nThink of it as hiring someone to raise your child.\nThis is a terrible idea in most cases.\nSame for a startup. The single best predictor for a startup's failure is the fact that they outsource their tech.\nEven worse: they outsource their marketing (before PMF)\n\n8. Building a vitamin, not a painkiller.\nMany founders don't have ideas. So they squeeze the idea out of the air, which often is a vitamin. It makes sense, but people can perfectly live without it.\nA painkiller: u pitch someone & they nag you every week asking for access.\n\n9. No passion for an audience & field.\n\n10. Lack of focus.\nCoding is easy now. I see too many founders jumping from idea to idea every month.\nNothing wrong with it, but for most, it'd make more sense to pivot existing ideas, instead of jumping into new ones.\nIt's best to become an expert in one field.\n\n11. Not using their own product.\n\n12. Not validating.\n\n13. Bet on non organic growth.\n\n14. Didn't plan for a marathon.\n\n15. Out of money.\n\n16. Not willing to learn, fixed on delegating.\nFounders thinking: I'm the General, I'll find people better than me in each position, delegate & we will win cuz that's what Steve Jobs said.\nIn reality, founders must do all important work until PMF. Employees can't handle it.\n\n17. That's it.\nBesides the failures, I\u2019ve built stuff millions use:\n\u21b3 https://lnkd.in/e65ijFNc website & directory builder.\n\u21b3 https://listingbott.com ai agent that lists you on all relevant web directories.\n\u21b3 https://seobotai.com ai agent to run your blog 100% on autopilot.\n\nsee full version on my X",

She began signing applications as \"M. Siebert.\"\n\nThe interviews started flowing in immediately.\n\nHer expertise in aerospace stocks quickly made her indispensable.\n\nThen she discovered male colleagues earned 2x her salary for identical work.\n\nThe only path to equal pay? \nBuy a seat on the NYSE: $445,000 ($4.2M today).\n\nBut Wall Street revealed its true nature:\n\u2022 9 of 10 firms refused to sponsor her application\n\u2022 Banks rejected her without a male signature\n\u2022 NYSE demanded a $300,000 guarantee (never required for men)\n\nAfter 2 years of persistence, Chase Manhattan finally approved her loan.\n\nDecember 28, 1967: Siebert bought her seat, becoming the only woman among 1,365 men.\n\nThen came the real obstacles:\n\u2022 No women's restroom on the trading floor\n\u2022 Barred from men-only clubs where deals happened\n\u2022 Constant pressure to leave\n\nHer response was legendary:\n\u2022 Threatened to install a portable toilet on the floor\n\u2022 Built her own powerful network\n\u2022 Launched one of the first discount brokerages\n\u2022 Became NY's first female Banking Superintendent\n\nUnder her leadership:\n\u2022 Not a single bank failed\n\u2022 She oversaw $500B in assets\n\u2022 First NYSE room named after an individual\n\u2022 Pioneered financial literacy in schools\n\nHer words still resonate:\n\"For 10 years, I was the only woman out of 1,365 men. I didn't speak for two years. How do you talk to people who don't want you there?\"\n\nThe lesson?\n\nSiebert saw value where others saw barriers\n\nJust like the best opportunities aren't where everyone's looking... \n\nThey're where everyone says \"impossible.\"\n\n-\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nI'm Baptiste Parravicini:\n\u2022 Tech entrepreneur & API visionary\n\u2022 Co-founder of apidays, world's leading API conference\n\u2022 Passionate about AI integration & tech for the greater good\n\nWant more on becoming the future of tech? \n\nCheck out the comments \u2b07\ufe0f",

People realized: If sellers paid to list items, they were probably legitimate.\n\nBut the platform faced a bigger challenge: \nGetting strangers to trust each other online.\n\nThe solution? \n\nA revolutionary feedback system where buyers and sellers could rate each other.\n\nThis became the blueprint for modern e-commerce trust.\n\nIn 2000, they made an even bolder move: Introducing fixed-price listings.\n\nCritics thought it would kill the auction format.\n\nInstead, it exploded growth - today, 90% of items sell through fixed prices.\n\nThe platform's current impact is staggering:\n\u2022 132 million active buyers\n\u2022 Operations in 190 markets\n\u2022 $73 billion in yearly transactions\n\nThe lesson?

          "full_content": "5 Step All-Bound System for Your B2B Company \n\nThis is what's working now (not mass cold outbound)...\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re currently setting up for companies:\n\nOur offering last year: mainly larger-scale outbound/volume campaigns.\n\nOur offering in January 2025: inbound/outbound demand generation and capture. Outbound based on lead intent \n\nWhy we needed to change what we do:\n\n- Email deliverability is extremely hard to get right.\n- Lower barrier to entry.\n\nThe Process\n\n1 - Know your ICP and own the data\n\nKnowing exactly who and where your ICP is key. \n\nStart by building a hyper-targeted list of companies or people you would ideally work with. \n\nFrom here, you can proceed without needing an expensive data source. \n\nJust add loads of filters and use Clay AI to find your ICP.\n\n- Apollo.io\n- ListKit\n- Instantly.ai\n- ocean.io\n\n\n2 - Create a modern outbound system\n\n- 50-100 domains.\n- 5-10 emails per domain per day.\n- Only send to Google domains.\n- Short email with no spam words.\n\nOnly reach out to hyper-segmented and targeted lists with a relevant offer and reason to contact. Include trigger-based systems. \n\nUse offsite tools like Vector \ud83d\udc7b to identify in-market leads, then use Clay to process, enrich, and add them to an Instantly.ai campaign.\n\n\n3 - Create a company content system\n\nAuthority and trust are the key differences between someone buying from you or a competitor. \n\nYes, it takes time to be effective, but once it\u2019s there, it\u2019s lasting. This is why big brands thrive. \n\nI recently created a post explaining how you can get yourself and your team to post high-quality content on LinkedIn. \n\nI also suggest creating content for a blog and any other channel your ICP views.\n\n\n4 - Capture and identify demand from your inbound\n\nWe need to identify content viewers in your ICP so we can target them. \n\nTo do this, use a tool like Trigify.io for LinkedIn content. \n\nFor other platforms, use lead magnets to capture contact info, providing value to the marketplace (this only works if the lead magnet is good). \n\nPush these leads to Clay for enrichment.\n\n\n5 - Convert outbound demand\n\nThe same goes for outbound: we need to convert positive replies into meetings or sales.\n\nRule #1: Reply within 15 minutes of receiving a response\u2014this is vital to increase the meeting booking rate. \n\nTrack all replies and send them into a CRM, which you can do with an Instantly.ai + Zapier integration.\n\n------\n\nThis is what is working right now. Make the most of it while you can.\n\nMessage me if you\u2019d like a more in-depth breakdown.",

Then adding the lead into Instantly. \n\n1 - Set up a Vector account.\n2 - Connect to Clay via a webhook.\n3 - In Clay, create a table and select \"Monitor Webhook.\"\n4 - Set up and test enrichments & qualification filters.\n5 - Add a column, search for \"Add lead to Instantly campaign.\"\n6 - Map fields and add extra info for Slack.\n\n\n--- Play 2 \u2192 Ad Click \u2192 Slack ---\n\nVector \ud83d\udc7b \u2192 Clay \u2192 Findymail \u2192 Slack\n\nThis is very similar to the play above.

We take positive replies in instantly and push them as a notification in slack (Yes this one doesn't involve clay, but it's a must have)\n\n1 - Create new zapier automation \n2 - Select Instantly as the trigger \n3 - Pick 'lead marked as interested'\n4 - Choose slack as the second part of the automation \n5 - Input the desired message an variables from Instantly \n\n--- Play 5 \u2192 Monitor signals \u2192 Email ---\n\nMonitor job titles changes, job changes and new hires using clay, enrich and run relevant emails \n\n1 - Create a new clay table\n2 - Choose desired signal to monitor \n3 - Upload or scrape desired list to monitor \n4 - Enrich in clay \n5 - Add a column, search for \"Add lead to Instantly campaign.\"\n6 - Map fields and add extra info for Instantly.\n7 - Run a test to verify leads go to the correct Instantly campaign.\n\n----\n\nThat's a wrap for this one.

Make videos that ANSWER QUESTIONS\n\nPeople think authority comes from some secret SEO formula....\nIt doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt comes from showing up - being the name people recognize in your space\n\nEveryone kept asking me the basics about cold email and finding clients\n\nAt first, I answered every time...\n\nThen I got tired of repeating myself and just started sending them links to my videos.\n\nLater I took it a step further - doing free marketing breakdowns for agencies and posting them.\n\nInstead of waiting for leads, I started cold emailing their CEOs with the breakdowns\n\nOur first six-figure agency client came from one of these. They saw the value, booked a call, and signed up\n\n100k contract just like that. No backlinks needed\n\nIf you want to shortcut this process and dominate your industry without years of trial and error, I\u2019ve laid out everything inside AB Mastermind.\n\nThat's why you get a 1-on-1 with me (14,000 clients, 500k sales meetings booked in the last 6 years, a dozen students with over a million a month in agency rev), plus 30+ hours of courses and 6 calls a week with my best coaches for cold email, LinkedIn, sales, agency growth, and mindset.\n\nGet in here (use the link in my bio)\n\nTalk soon,\nAlex\n\nP.S. A Mastermind client just posted about his 26.67% cold call meeting book rate. If you had the same results, how much would you make?",

Hoping that one big deal will\u00a0finally fix everything\n\u00a0\nI used to think scaling was about grinding harder\n\u00a0\nMore hours. More deals. More hustle.\n\u00a0\nAnd for a while it worked\n\u00a0\nWhen I was working with my\u00a0first boss\u2019s agency\u00a0I wasn\u2019t just another consultant\n\u00a0\nI was their number one sales guy that year\n\u00a0\nI built their entire marketing funnel closed over a million in deals, and landed them a\u00a01.5 million a year client from an RFP\u00a0that no one else wanted to touch\n\u00a0\nAnd then something crazy happened\n\u00a0\nThe calls started rolling in\n\u00a0\nNot for them - for me\n\u00a0\nAgencies were reaching out to the company but not to hire them\n\u00a0\nThey wanted to talk about me\n\u00a0\nOne day my boss pulled me aside and said\n\u00a0\n\"Dude can you stop featuring us so much? I'm getting more calls about you than from my own clients\"\n\u00a0\nLuckily by then we\u2019d already\u00a0closed 600k ARR in 2 months, and had a flood of other success stories to reference\n\u00a0\nThat was the moment I realized something\n\u00a0\nI wasn\u2019t just building businesses - I was creating systems that scaled them\n\u00a0\nI wasn\u2019t chasing leads - my work was making them come to me\n\u00a0\nI didn\u2019t need to sell anymore - our process was so dialed in it did the work for me\n\u00a0\nFast forward to today\n\u00a0\nI only focus on businesses that run lean, print cash, and don\u2019t stress me out\n\u00a0\nAB Mastermind is exactly that\n\u00a0\n* No debt\n* No crazy overhead\n* No stress\n\u00a0\nClients come in every month like clockwork because we\u2019ve built a foolproof system that lands\u00a05-10 high-value deals every single month\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the same system that\u2019s helped a client recently go from a cold start to:\n\u00a0\n* Closing 520k in two months\n* Building an end-to-end sales system\n* Raising 3 million in funding\n* Going for a 10 million Series A\n\u00a0\nHis words - \"Honestly, we could have closed over a million in that time\"\n\u00a0\nThis is what we do in\u00a0AB Mastermind\n\u00a0\nWe take people from grinding to survive to scaling without stress\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re still running your business like this next year - will you still be stuck grinding?

But asking the right questions, at the right time, has taken our ACV from $2K to over $30K for all new opportunities.\n\nHere's the Story:\n\nWe've all been on an intro call.\n\nTalking to a new prospect. With limited information.\n\nTrying to figure it out.\n\nWhy are they here? (Understanding pain & urgency)\n\nIf that is solved, then trying to find...\n\nHow do they actually buy? (Eliminating roadblocks)\n\nMost reps (including myself) focus too much on the first and completely fumble the second.\n\n\n1) The Discovery Phase: Ask Harder Questions\n\nIn the beginning of my selling journey, like many AEs, I was sugarcoating questions like, \u201cDoes this seem interesting?\u201d Instead, get to the real motivation:\n\n\u21b3 \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d (If inbound, don\u2019t assume\u2014make them say it.)\n\u21b3  \"If we could achieve [X], what would that mean for the company?\u201d Follow up: \u201cAnd why is that important?\u201d\n\u21b3 \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for you personally?\u201d (Bonus? Promotion? Job security?)\n\nGoing one level deeper creates urgency. It shifts the conversation from \u201cjust exploring\u201d to \u201cI need this now.\u201d\n\nDoing this well gets them to a \"soft yes\".\n\n\n2) The Next Steps Phase: Stop Chasing, Start Closing\n\nHow many prospects say \u201cthis sounds great\u201d and then disappear? What fixed it for me was these kind of direct questions:\n\n\u21b3 \u201cDo you see anyone internally opposing this?\u201d (Identify silent deal-killers.)\n\u21b3 \u201cAre you the sole decision-maker?\u201d If yes, close them now. If not, ask: \n\u21b3 \u201cWhat does your boss typically care about?\u201d\n\u21b3 \u201cCan we get on a call with them before you pitch internally?\u201d\n\nEliminate all major roadblocks. Give them the tools to sell internally.\n\nWhich is where most new deals get shot down.\n\nGetting in front of after call objections. \n\nHelps both the buyer and the seller.\n\n---\n\nI've learned the best AEs don\u2019t \u201chope\u201d deals close. \n\nThey make sure of it\u2014on the call.\n\nAny good questions I'm missing?

The data is crystal clear: live video outperforms other formats in terms of views, interactions, and watch time.\n\n2. It\u2019s the next best thing to being in the same room. Trust is everything in 2025, and live video builds trust faster than any other medium. Your audience sees the real you, in real time.\n\n3. Most of your competitors won\u2019t do it. \nHere\u2019s why:\nThey lack the confidence.\nThey\u2019re not true experts and fear being exposed.\nThey\u2019re not willing to invest the time to truly serve their audience.\n\n When your audience sees you show up, they feel connected. And connection drives trust. Trust drives business.\n\nThe business owners that win in 2025 will be the ones that go LIVE. It\u2019s not about perfection\u2014it\u2019s about proving you care by showing up and helping people in real time.",

How saturated (or not) an industry is in your market\n\nIs to post a small warehouse for rent on FB Marketplace.\n\nDon't own one? That's fine. Post a picture of one just to learn.\n\nI happen to own one, and it is so fascinating to learn the types of businesses people own and how well they are doing.\n\nThese are a few I've learned about:\n\n- Classic car storage\n\n- Hot air balloon repair (Chick Fil A is their biggest customer)\n\n- Art studio rental (think WeWork for small art studios)\n\n- Concession trailers\n\nAll from this little ugly warehouse. There is no shortage of demand for these things.\n\nSomeone needs to raise a couple hundred mill to build or buy a ton of them in the exurbs.\n\nFollow me Chris Koerner if you found this interesting!",

Tomorrow is too late. \nAI isn\u2019t something to plan for \u201csomeday.\u201d It\u2019s already transforming industries. If you don\u2019t act now, you\u2019ll be playing catch-up while others lead.\n\n\u2192\u00a0Start small. \nYou don\u2019t need a massive AI transformation to make an impact. Pick a project that can be executed quickly\u2014something simple but valuable. Test, refine, and build momentum.\n\n\u2192\u00a0Focus on high-impact, low-effort wins first. \nFind the quick wins\u2014process automation, data insights, or AI-driven customer interactions\u2014that deliver immediate value with minimal disruption. These will prove AI\u2019s worth and help secure buy-in for bigger moves.\n\n\u2192\u00a0Upskill your team.\nAI adoption isn\u2019t just about technology\u2014it\u2019s about people. Your team will drive this change, but only if they have the right skills. Invest in AI literacy, training, and experimentation.\n\n\u2192\u00a0Be open to challenges and possible failures. \nAI adoption is a process of learning. Not everything will work immediately, and that\u2019s okay. The companies that succeed are the ones willing to iterate, adapt, and push forward.\n\n\nAI isn\u2019t the future\u2014it\u2019s the present. The winners will be those who do, not just discuss.\n\nWhat\u2019s stopping more CEOs from taking action? Fear? Uncertainty? Lack of leadership?
