Be the type of person who reaches out to others... when you don't need something.\n\n3. The greatest muscle you can build is urgency.\n\n4. Most successful people move with this mindset: Entitled to nothing, willing to earn everything.\n\n5. Pray like it's up to God. Work like it's up to you.\n\n6. You don't need more time, you need a deadline.\n\n7. The success you are looking for is waiting for you in the work you're currently avoiding.\n\n8. Biographies of billionaires teach you more than self-help business books.\n\n9. Your lack of focus will kill you before your competitors ever get a chance.\n\n10. Winning isn't an accident, it's earned.\n\n11. Underrated superpower: Just dumb enough to believe in yourself, just smart enough to execute.\n\n12. Complexity makes you seem smart. Simplicity makes you money.\n\n13. Surround yourself with owners, the conversation is just different.\n\n14. The more you learn about money, the more you realize most of us play with Legos while the really rich play chess.\n\n15. Beginners do too much. Pros do only what's needed.\n\n16. Underperformers want ease. Midperformers want credit. Winners want pressure.\n\n17. Your most expensive mistake will be a \"who,\" not a \"what.\"\n\n18. If you've survived this far, the odds are actually are in your favor.\n\n19. The formula is: keep going after it gets hard.\n\n20. Your goal as CEO is to build a team that runs your entire company better than you.\n\n21. The biggest change in wealth will happen when you realize $1,000,000 is not a lot of money.\n\n22. There is no good or bad except by comparison.\n\n23. Behind every successful entrepreneur is a bad former manager.\n\n24. You underestimate how much more you can make in your career if you are likable.\n\n25. You\u2019ll never be a good entrepreneur if you can\u2019t solve problems at your job.\n\n26. A fear of losing money will stop you from making it.\n\n27. It is very hard to change the world when you are broke. Don't apologize for chasing money.\n\n28.

Beware of favors, there is usually a price.\n\n31. Fail, you only pay once. Regret, you pay for the rest of your life.\n\n32. The new rich is peace.\n\n33. The world is run by failed employees.\n\n34. If you can pay to steal someone else's 10,000 hours, do it.\n\n35. Never bet against someone who just keeps taking swings.\n\n36.

    "full_content": "AI Product Management\n\nAI Product Management is evolving rapidly. The growth of generative AI and AI-based developer tools has created numerous opportunities to build AI applications. This is making it possible to build new kinds of things, which in turn is driving shifts in best practices in product management \u2014 the discipline of defining what to build to serve users \u2014 because what is possible to build has shifted. In this post, I\u2019ll share some best practices I have noticed.\n\nUse concrete examples to specify AI products. Starting with a concrete idea helps teams gain speed. If a product manager (PM) proposes to build \u201ca chatbot to answer banking inquiries that relate to user accounts,\u201d this is a vague specification that leaves much to the imagination. For instance, should the chatbot answer questions only about account balances or also about interest rates, processes for initiating a wire transfer, and so on? But if the PM writes out a number (say, between 10 and 50) of concrete examples of conversations they\u2019d like a chatbot to execute, the scope of their proposal becomes much clearer. Just as a machine learning algorithm needs training examples to learn from, an AI product development team needs concrete examples of what we want an AI system to do. In other words, the data is your PRD (product requirements document)!\n\nIn a similar vein, if someone requests \u201ca vision system to detect pedestrians outside our store,\u201d it\u2019s hard for a developer to understand the boundary conditions. Is the system expected to work at night? What is the range of permissible camera angles? Is it expected to detect pedestrians who appear in the image even though they\u2019re 100m away? But if the PM collects a handful of pictures and annotates them with the desired output, the meaning of \u201cdetect pedestrians\u201d becomes concrete. An engineer can assess if the specification is technically feasible and if so, build toward it. Initially, the data might be obtained via a one-off, scrappy process, such as the PM walking around taking pictures and annotating them. Eventually, the data mix will shift to real-word data collected by a system running in production.\n\nUsing examples (such as inputs and desired outputs) to specify a product has been helpful for many years, but the explosion of possible AI applications is creating a need for more product managers to learn this practice.\n\nAssess technical feasibility of LLM-based applications by prompting. When a PM scopes out a potential AI application, whether the application can actually be built \u2014 that is, its technical feasibility \u2014 is a key criterion in deciding what to do next. For many ideas for LLM-based applications, it\u2019s increasingly possible for a PM, who might not be a software engineer, to try prompting \u2014 or write just small amounts of code \u2014 to get an initial sense of feasibility.\n\n[Reached length limit.

Their products were designed in a pre-AI world, with pre-AI economics. They have massive teams, expensive infrastructure, and shareholders demanding consistent growth.\n\nAnd more people than ever want to use these products, but they don't want to pay another monthly subscription. \n\nMeanwhile, a small team of vibe coders could band together tomorrow and build 90%+ of the functionality in weeks, not years and offer it for FREE to 99% of users. Thanks to tools like Replit, V0, Cursor, Bolt, Lovable etc and all these open-source models.\n\nAnd instead of charging monthly, you give it out for free, and charge power users per outcome. And you can layer on premium service to cash flow (I can talk about that on another tweet on what I'd do)\n\nWhat's holding people back? Is it the fear of taking on giants? The allure of building something \"new\" instead of \"better\"? Or people just like building on their own so they don't want to band together?\n\nI think the avg customer prefers a one-stop shop for all these free new AI saas powered tools. \n\nYou don't need to raise VC if you don't want to. \n\nEvery time I open one of these legacy products and see the same old interfaces with the same old limitations, I can't help but think we're at the beginning of a massive wealth transfer from incumbents to the teams bold enough to rebuild them from scratch.\n\nI'm not saying these incumbents are going to die btw. But I do think there's an opportunity (yeah a really big one) to peel off some of their sweet saas revenue and monetize it differently. Make it free for most. \n\nNothing people hate more than a monthly subscription. \n\nHappy building.\n\ni've shared 30+ more startup ideas you can steal here https://lnkd.in/dGt8Cch4",

Write effective hooks\n\nYour hook\u2014the first 10% of your post\u2014decides whether or not people read the last 90% of it.\n\nLike it or not, you\u2019re competing for attention.\n\nIf your hook isn\u2019t interesting, your readers will scroll to something more interesting.\n\n2. Be consistent\n\nPublishing content on LinkedIn consistently is the price of entry\u2014you can\u2019t succeed without it.\n\nThat said, consistency isn\u2019t enough by itself.\n\nYour target needs to be undeniably valuable to a clearly defined target audience who can pay for more of your knowledge.\n\nInterview your target market to learn their pain points. Then, build content pillars around each of those pain points.\n\nResults are inevitable.\n\n3. Respond to your comments\n\nLinkedIn values community much more than any other social media platform\u2014\n\nThis means they want to see authors engaging with their audience (and other industry peers).\n\nCreators who take the time to respond won\u2019t just enjoy greater reach, but deeper audience connections, too.\n\n4. Experiment with different formats\n\nFor most authors, written posts aren\u2019t enough to make the most of LinkedIn anymore\u2026\n\nCarousels tend to get the most reach, while video creates the deepest psychological connections.\n\n(There\u2019s also some evidence LinkedIn is pushing videos more in the feed than it used to)\n\n5. Write for your target audience\n\nStop trying to \u201cgo viral\u201d and \u201cgo value\u201d instead.\n\n10,000,000 views from total strangers are worthless if they\u2019re not interested in your actual expertise as a professional\u2026\n\nSure, a few of them may hit the follow button, but they won\u2019t stick around if you\u2019re just another \u201cinfluencer\u201d handing out dopamine hits.\n\nThe real winners on LinkedIn focus on audience quality.\n\nAll it takes is the right impression on the right people to create high-paying clients (and life-changing results).\n\nThose are some of my favorite \u201cbasic\u201d LinkedIn tips\u2014\n\nWhat are yours?",

    "full_content": "If you want to acquire a million-dollar company, you don\u2019t need to have millions.\n\nHere\u2019s how to buy a business that pays for itself (9 negotiation tips for seller financing):\n\nFirst up, seller financing means you agree to pay the seller back over time directly using the profits of the business.\n\nWhy would you want to do such a thing?\n\n2 main reasons:\n\n\u2022 You pay less out of pocket, without needing bank approval.\n\u2022 The seller keeps skin in the game. It's now in their best interest to give you a business that will continue to profit.\n\nSounds great as a buyer, but why would a seller ever say yes to this?\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s faster than bank loans\n\u2022 They can ask for a higher price\n\u2022 They pocket interest, instead of the bank\n\u2022 Tax payments get dispersed\n\nBut there are some hurdles to seller financing:\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s harder than applying for a bank loan\n\u2022 Sellers need to be \u201csold\u201d on it\n\u2022 Many sellers will still say no\n\nSo let\u2019s look at 9 ways to increase your odds of seller financing a deal:\n\n1. ALWAYS ASK.\n\nSeller financing isn\u2019t all or nothing. ALWAYS feel out how much the seller will finance. Maybe you only get $300k on a $3M deal. That's $300k not out of YOUR pocket.\n\n2. Relationship Is the Foundation\n\nYour odds of getting financing increase as your rapport with the seller increases.\n\n3. Seller Risk\n\nYou\u2019ll get pushback. Get to the bottom of WHY the seller is hesitant. It\u2019s often not a no, just an \u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d Find out what will make them sure.\n\n4. Your Price, My Terms\n\nSeller wants $250k more for the biz? Alright, then you the buyer get to hold the reigns on the interest rate, length of payback period, and other levers.\n\n5. Presentation\n\nYou are PITCHING a seller, so go back to negotiation 101:\n\u2022 Don\u2019t play all your cards at once\n\u2022 Focus on where the seller\u2019s head is at & what they need to move the deal forward\n\n6. Throwaway Terms\n\nThe seller\u2019s mind is running through worst case scenarios. Most of those scenarios have a .0001% chance of happening, so you can put them in the contract anyway.\n\n7. Fallback Positions\n\nThese are backup terms you don\u2019t want to lead with, but would compromise for.\n\n8. Knowledge vs Wisdom\n\nKeep rebuttals to seller concerns in your back pocket. But don\u2019t just rattle off a bunch of terms and benefits. Understand their fear/concern \u2192 then propose the solution for it\n\n9. Creative Solutions\n\nEvery deal is full of problems. The fun of it is finding creative solutions.\n\nDon't let \"this is the usual way\" stop you from \"this makes me more.\"\n\nRelated:\n\nTOMORROW you can get live teaching from experts + breakout sessions with like-minded people on:\n\n\u2022 Seller financing\n\u2022 Deal clarity\n\u2022 Financial analysis\n\u2022 & the rest of the acquisition process\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Tickets available here (until midnight!): https://lnkd.in/ebZSU7TT",

You're LUCKY to hit 15% margins after paying employees, rent etc. \n\nMost agency founders spend their Sundays dreading Monday's personnel issues.\n\nbut I'm watching something fascinating emerge in 2025 and i wanted to share it with you. \n\nAI agents aren't perfect yet. but the writing is on the wall: what currently takes 50 people will soon be done by 2 people orchestrating 50 AI workers. \n\nsame revenue, but margins jump from 20% to 80%. no overhead, no drama, pure profit. clients pay less, get faster work.\n\non the outside, nothing will change. same agency, same deliverables. but on the inside,  pure sweet software margins. yum.\n\ni wouldnt be surprised if suddenly silicon valley liked the agency business. just a way to learn a workflow, automate, build a cash-machine and invest that into tech that makes the whole machine work smoother.\n\nme and my holdco (we've got a few agencies) will invest millions of dollars into this. putting our money where our mouth is.\n\nturns out agencies were just one letter off - they're becoming agent-cies.\n\nthis wave is coming fast.\n\nfor 30+ startup ideas i love (some AI ones), grab them for free at https://lnkd.in/eKicBBqe \n\nor 6 tools i use to validate business ideas here https://lnkd.in/eR_kjAWP",

Would have cost $2,000 with a lawyer. \n\nWhen I sent it to my attorney to review, his response was \"looks good\" 2 days later.\n\nI had already sent the contract lol. It was signed by the client. Thanks Mr. Attorney.\n\nLawyers and accountants keep insisting that AI is just a toy and real work requires human judgment. Meanwhile, their billable hours model is silently imploding.\n\nI've watched this pattern play out before. First comes denial. Then \"it only works for simple stuff.\" Then \"it can't handle nuance.\" Finally, massive restructuring.\n\nLaw firms won't disappear, but the pyramid of junior associates doing document review and contract drafting is evaporating overnight. What nobody's talking about is how the next generation will learn when the entry-level jobs that have always been the training ground are precisely what AI does best.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the biggest shock to law firms comes when their own clients start bringing AI-drafted documents to meetings and just asking for quick reviews. \n\nThe real change won't be dramatic - it'll be the slow realization that clients are paying for 1 hour of work instead of 10, while still getting the same outcome. \n\nIt'll be death by a thousand cuts as more routine legal work gets handled by in-house teams with AI assistance.\n\nWe're watching the complete reinvention of professional services happen in real-time, and pretending nothing will change.",

The coffee shop that obsessed over single-origin beans.\n\nSoftware is about to go through the same transformation.\n\nWhen it cost millions to build products, you had to be Oracle \u2013 selling everything to everyone. But AI has changed that equation entirely.\n\nNow, the most interesting opportunities look more like specialty stores. Not because they're small, but because they can go deeper than big companies ever could:\n\nA $50k/month product that serves accountants at law firms better than QuickBooks.\n\nA tiny CRM that understands real estate agents better than SAP.\nA marketing tool that serves Substack writers better than Mailchimp.\n\nThe winners won't just build one specialty store. They'll build collections of them. That's where holdcos come in.\n\nInstead of raising venture capital to build one massive product, smart founders are bootstrapping portfolios of focused products. Each might be small, but together? They're building a cash-flowing portfolio. \n\nNot crazy that we'll see $50M-$1B exits \u2014 but with teams of 25 or less.  Big, medium and small exits, probably mostly bootstrapped. \n\nLots of dividends along the way which is rare in VC startup land.\n\nThink of it like collecting art pieces or real estate properties. Each piece cash flows on its own. But the portfolio compounds into something much bigger.\n\n\"BuT loTs oF PeOpLe WiLL fAiL.\"\n\nYeah, you're right. Not everyone will create products and portfolios people love. They won't.\n\nIt won\u2019t get any easier to build a startup that people love. Competition will probably go up. But costs are going down, and the ability to find customers has never been easier \u2014 if you know how to build internet audiences and create ad creative that stops the scroll.\n\nBuuuuut I am saying this:\n\nHow people are building software is changing.\n\nI'm saying small code is the new big code.\n\nMy latest free growth guide is available for download and how to use AI/organic social to grow your startup: https://lnkd.in/eFfS4QfY",

The Success-Only Trap\n\nThey look only at what worked, never what failed.\n\nIt\u2019s like studying only lottery winners to understand how to win the lottery.\n\n2. The False Attribution Trap\n\nThey attribute success to things they can control instead of what matters:\n\nSaying something worth paying attention to.\n\n3. The Correlation Confusion\n\nThey mistake correlation for causation.\n\nJust because something happened before success doesn\u2019t mean it caused success.\n\nAnd the truth is, the content format doesn\u2019t matter (much).\n\nWhat drives actual LinkedIn success is\u2026\n\n1. Credibility (Do people trust your expertise?)\n2. Value (Are you saying something worth hearing?)\n3. Clarity (Can people understand your point quickly?)\n4. Luck (Will the algorithm pick it up? Will it show it to the right audience?)\n\nEverything else is just optimization.\n\nI\u2019ve seen too many people chase vanity metrics that lead to zero business results.\n\nBelow, I break down the metrics that matter and how to build real LinkedIn success.\n\nRead my complete guide for the full breakdown on how to cut through the \u201cLinkedIn noise\u201d:\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dJb_ZwSG",

Didn\u2019t start making real moves to solve them until around a month ago.\n\nAs a result, our churn rate has been a source of great frustration and disappointment.\n\nHere are the four biggest mistakes I think we made over the past four months:\u00a0 \n\n- We JUST built the Salesforce integration for our larger prospects\n- We JUST rebuilt our Hubspot integration to filter, route, alert, add to lead score, and start automations within the CRM\n- We STILL have not teed up suggested messages using AI (the \u201cwhat now\u201d?)\n- I ROYALLY screwed up our pricing on launch, and cost us 2mo of growth\n\nIf I had to do it all over again I would have done things sooo differently.\n\nBut that's almost the case in startup-land.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHaving said all that... \n\nI\u2019m very optimistic that we can hit $10m ARR in the next 12mo.\n\nEven though $10m will be MUCH harder than $5m because of our high churn.\n\nWhat are our plans for the next 12mo? \n\n1. Add worldwide, company-level ID, partnered with DemandBase\n2. Add a job change signal (and then others)\n3. Resolve the \u201cwhat now\u201d problem using AI\n\nStrategically, we want to try to get reps valuable signals with the simplest possible delivery, WITHOUT having to adopt a new platform, at a great price.\n\nWe think we can do most of what needs to be done in the CRM\u2026 \n\nFor a HIGH percentage of the workflows our competitors accomplish in their platforms.\n\nAnd we think that NOT adopting a platform is very attractive to a large part of the market.\n\nI have no idea if this is the right move\u2026 \n\nAnd it\u2019s certainly going the opposite direction of anyone doing anything like us.\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing that makes me the most excited about it. \n\nStupid Simple Sales Signals. \n\nIt has a nice ring to it.",

Competition:\nIf competitors are at 1,000 words, make a more thorough article that\u2019s 1,500+ words.\n\n2.

    "full_content": "Why Startup Founders Fail: \n\n(based on my own failures & 100+ founders in my network)\n\n1. Solution looking for a problem.\nFounders build a solution first and then go to users, pitching it and trying to convince them they have such a problem.\n\n2. They like it, but won't pay.\nOften happens to \"vitamin\" products.\n\n3. Failed to monetize b2c.\nOnce, I built an app with over 100k users, and was 1st on App Store with an award. But once I wanted to monetize it, I realized it was impossible to make good money here. \n\n4. Raised VC money for a non-unicorn idea.\nVCs make 100 bets. You're just one of 100. The chance you fail is 99%, because for VCs anything is a failure except unicorns.\nYou could turn it into $10m/year biz in a bootstrapped mode, but VCs will force u to bankrupt such company.\n\n\n5. Wrong cofounder.\nWhen 2 people start a company, and 1 quits, the other one isn't that crazy about working their ass off for this startup to succeed.\nMost startups I know that lost one of their cofounders early failed. I think cofounders bring more risk than upside.\n\n6. Small market.\nIn Norway, where I spent most of my life building my startups, most would first start with a local market.\nI thought it was smart, but the aftermath of the last 15 years shows that it was the reason for the downfall of the Norwegian startup ecosystem.\n\n7. Outsourcing.\nThink of it as hiring someone to raise your child.\nThis is a terrible idea in most cases.\nSame for a startup. The single best predictor for a startup's failure is the fact that they outsource their tech.\nEven worse: they outsource their marketing (before PMF)\n\n8. Building a vitamin, not a painkiller.\nMany founders don't have ideas. So they squeeze the idea out of the air, which often is a vitamin. It makes sense, but people can perfectly live without it.\nA painkiller: u pitch someone & they nag you every week asking for access.\n\n9. No passion for an audience & field.\n\n10. Lack of focus.\nCoding is easy now. I see too many founders jumping from idea to idea every month.\nNothing wrong with it, but for most, it'd make more sense to pivot existing ideas, instead of jumping into new ones.\nIt's best to become an expert in one field.\n\n11. Not using their own product.\n\n12. Not validating.\n\n13. Bet on non organic growth.\n\n14. Didn't plan for a marathon.\n\n15. Out of money.\n\n16. Not willing to learn, fixed on delegating.\nFounders thinking: I'm the General, I'll find people better than me in each position, delegate & we will win cuz that's what Steve Jobs said.\nIn reality, founders must do all important work until PMF. Employees can't handle it.\n\n17. That's it.\nBesides the failures, I\u2019ve built stuff millions use:\n\u21b3 https://lnkd.in/e65ijFNc website & directory builder.\n\u21b3 https://listingbott.com ai agent that lists you on all relevant web directories.\n\u21b3 https://seobotai.com ai agent to run your blog 100% on autopilot.\n\nsee full version on my X",

    "full_content": "Subject lines are the hardest type of \"hook\" to write. So I created an AI prompt that makes it 10x easier:\n\nBut first, why is writing great subject lines so hard?\n\nSimple:\n\nBecause you have a such big \u201clength\u201d constraint.\n\n(For context: Ideally, a subject line can only have 40-45 characters.)\n\nAnd the more concise you have to be, the harder it is to write something good - and the more thought it requires.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s 2 \u201chacks\u201d that can make it 10x easier to write a potent subject line:\n\n\u2022 Starting with an already proven hook (so you don\u2019t need to start \u201cfrom scratch)\n\n\u2022 Using an AI tool like Claude or ChatGPT to accelerate your \u201cbrainstorming\u201d process (so you can find the best formats & angles, faster)\n\nSo with this in mind, I created a plug-and-play AI prompt to help you write irresistible subject lines - 10x faster!\n\nAll you need?\n\nA proven Twitter/X or LinkedIn hook.\n\nIt can be yours or it can be someone else\u2019s.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve found it, all you need to do is fill in the prompt below & feed it to your favorite AI tool.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n\"You\u2019re a world-class email copywriter. I want your help turning a viral LinkedIn hook I recently found into an attention-grabbing subject line.\n\nSo, here's what we're going to do:\n\nI'm going to share with you the LinkedIn hook and then I want you to come up with 15 different subject line variations inspired by that hook.\n\nNow, here are a few important guidelines you should follow when brainstorming each subject line variation:\n\n\u2022 The subject line shouldn't have more than 45 characters (including spaces)\n\n\u2022 The subject line needs to be clear (not clever) but also create a \"curiosity gap\" (i.e. We can't give the reader the \"answer.\" Instead we need to give them a reason to want to open the email.)\n\n\u2022 The subject line should be formatted in sentence case (never capitalize the first letter of each word because we don't want our subject lines to read like an article headline).\n\n\u2022 For each subject line variation we come up with, we also need to generate a \"preview text.\" (For context: the \"preview text\" is the copy that shows up right next to or underneath the email subject line on people's inbox, and it acts almost a sub-headline.)\n\n\u2022 The preview text should *complement* NOT repeat the same idea that's being communicated in the subject line. We also want to avoid repeating any words that have already been used in the headline. (Again, we want to use the \"preview text\" as a sub-headline.)\n\n\u2022 Lastly, please structure your output in the following way:\n\n[Heading] Subject Line X\n\n\u2022 Subject line: [insert subject line variation]\n\u2022 Preview text: [insert preview text variation]\n\nSo here you go - here's my LinkedIn hook:\"\n\nPS - Want to get this prompt in a Notion doc?\n\nComment \"prompt\" and I'll send it over (along with another bonus prompt).",
