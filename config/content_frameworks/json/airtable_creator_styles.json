        "full_content": "AI Product Management\n\nAI Product Management is evolving rapidly. The growth of generative AI and AI-based developer tools has created numerous opportunities to build AI applications. This is making it possible to build new kinds of things, which in turn is driving shifts in best practices in product management \u2014 the discipline of defining what to build to serve users \u2014 because what is possible to build has shifted. In this post, I\u2019ll share some best practices I have noticed.\n\nUse concrete examples to specify AI products. Starting with a concrete idea helps teams gain speed. If a product manager (PM) proposes to build \u201ca chatbot to answer banking inquiries that relate to user accounts,\u201d this is a vague specification that leaves much to the imagination. For instance, should the chatbot answer questions only about account balances or also about interest rates, processes for initiating a wire transfer, and so on? But if the PM writes out a number (say, between 10 and 50) of concrete examples of conversations they\u2019d like a chatbot to execute, the scope of their proposal becomes much clearer. Just as a machine learning algorithm needs training examples to learn from, an AI product development team needs concrete examples of what we want an AI system to do. In other words, the data is your PRD (product requirements document)!\n\nIn a similar vein, if someone requests \u201ca vision system to detect pedestrians outside our store,\u201d it\u2019s hard for a developer to understand the boundary conditions. Is the system expected to work at night? What is the range of permissible camera angles? Is it expected to detect pedestrians who appear in the image even though they\u2019re 100m away? But if the PM collects a handful of pictures and annotates them with the desired output, the meaning of \u201cdetect pedestrians\u201d becomes concrete. An engineer can assess if the specification is technically feasible and if so, build toward it. Initially, the data might be obtained via a one-off, scrappy process, such as the PM walking around taking pictures and annotating them. Eventually, the data mix will shift to real-word data collected by a system running in production.\n\nUsing examples (such as inputs and desired outputs) to specify a product has been helpful for many years, but the explosion of possible AI applications is creating a need for more product managers to learn this practice.\n\nAssess technical feasibility of LLM-based applications by prompting. When a PM scopes out a potential AI application, whether the application can actually be built \u2014 that is, its technical feasibility \u2014 is a key criterion in deciding what to do next. For many ideas for LLM-based applications, it\u2019s increasingly possible for a PM, who might not be a software engineer, to try prompting \u2014 or write just small amounts of code \u2014 to get an initial sense of feasibility.\n\n[Reached length limit.

Created with Together AI and AI Dungeon/Latitude, taught by Niki Birkner, Senior Product Manager at Together AI, and Nick Walton, CEO and Co-Founder of Latitude.\n\nThis course shows you how to use large language models to create and power a text-based game that you can share with your friends and family. You\u2019ll build a world with hierarchical content generation, a method that allows you to leverage LLMs to create a vast amount of content with a high level of control and consistency. For instance, if you were building a fantasy world with several kingdoms, in which each kingdom has multiple towns, and each town has several locations and residents, creating all this content from scratch can easily become tedious and difficult to track.\n\nWith hierarchical content generation, you can create information about your world, shape its direction with a human-in-the-loop, and keep it consistent, with little effort based on your prompts.\n\nBy the end of this course, you\u2019ll know how to prompt engineer to create a layered and interwoven world and integrate it into an AI roleplay game that is interesting, interactive, and safe to share with anyone. \n\nIn detail, you\u2019ll:\u00a0\n- Learn to implement game mechanics using AI to parse text data into structured JSON output, enabling features like an inventory system.\n- Use game mechanics with story and state components that feed into one another to improve your game's memory, and gives the player a steady state of the world.\n- Learn to enforce safety and compliance for AI content generation and create custom policies using Llama Guard.\n\nWith these techniques, you'll be equipped to build AI-powered applications, starting with your own game.\n\nPlease sign up here:\u00a0 https://lnkd.in/gwwkVUwj",

Didn\u2019t start making real moves to solve them until around a month ago.\n\nAs a result, our churn rate has been a source of great frustration and disappointment.\n\nHere are the four biggest mistakes I think we made over the past four months:\u00a0 \n\n- We JUST built the Salesforce integration for our larger prospects\n- We JUST rebuilt our Hubspot integration to filter, route, alert, add to lead score, and start automations within the CRM\n- We STILL have not teed up suggested messages using AI (the \u201cwhat now\u201d?)\n- I ROYALLY screwed up our pricing on launch, and cost us 2mo of growth\n\nIf I had to do it all over again I would have done things sooo differently.\n\nBut that's almost the case in startup-land.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHaving said all that... \n\nI\u2019m very optimistic that we can hit $10m ARR in the next 12mo.\n\nEven though $10m will be MUCH harder than $5m because of our high churn.\n\nWhat are our plans for the next 12mo? \n\n1. Add worldwide, company-level ID, partnered with DemandBase\n2. Add a job change signal (and then others)\n3. Resolve the \u201cwhat now\u201d problem using AI\n\nStrategically, we want to try to get reps valuable signals with the simplest possible delivery, WITHOUT having to adopt a new platform, at a great price.\n\nWe think we can do most of what needs to be done in the CRM\u2026 \n\nFor a HIGH percentage of the workflows our competitors accomplish in their platforms.\n\nAnd we think that NOT adopting a platform is very attractive to a large part of the market.\n\nI have no idea if this is the right move\u2026 \n\nAnd it\u2019s certainly going the opposite direction of anyone doing anything like us.\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing that makes me the most excited about it. \n\nStupid Simple Sales Signals. \n\nIt has a nice ring to it.",

You underestimate how much more you can make in your career if you are likable.\n\n25. You\u2019ll never be a good entrepreneur if you can\u2019t solve problems at your job.\n\n26. A fear of losing money will stop you from making it.\n\n27. It is very hard to change the world when you are broke. Don't apologize for chasing money.\n\n28.

Be the type of person who reaches out to others... when you don't need something. \n \n3. The greatest muscle you can build is urgency. \n \n4. Most successful people move with this mindset: Entitled to nothing, willing to earn everything. \n \n5. Pray like it's up to God. Work like it's up to you. \n \n6. You don't need more time, you need a deadline. \n \n7. The success you are looking for is waiting for you in the work you are currently avoiding. \n \n8. Biographies of billionaires teach you more than self-help books. \n \n9. Your lack of focus will kill you before your competitors ever get a chance. \n \n10. Winning isn't an accident, it's earned. \n \n11. Underrated superpower: Just dumb enough to believe in yourself, just smart enough to execute. \n \n12. Complexity makes you seem smart. Simplicity makes you money. \n \n13. Surround yourself with owners, the conversation is just different. \n \n14. The more you learn about money, the more you realize most of us play with Legos while the really rich play chess. \n \n15. Beginners do too much. Pros do only what's needed. \n \n16. Underperformers want ease. Midperformers want credit. Winners want pressure. \n \n17. Your most expensive mistake will be a \"who,\" not a \"what.\" \n \n18.

        "full_content": "If you want to acquire a million-dollar company, you don\u2019t need to have millions.\n\nHere\u2019s how to buy a business that pays for itself (9 negotiation tips for seller financing):\n\nFirst up, seller financing means you agree to pay the seller back over time directly using the profits of the business.\n\nWhy would you want to do such a thing?\n\n2 main reasons:\n\n\u2022 You pay less out of pocket, without needing bank approval.\n\u2022 The seller keeps skin in the game. It's now in their best interest to give you a business that will continue to profit.\n\nSounds great as a buyer, but why would a seller ever say yes to this?\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s faster than bank loans\n\u2022 They can ask for a higher price\n\u2022 They pocket interest, instead of the bank\n\u2022 Tax payments get dispersed\n\nBut there are some hurdles to seller financing:\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s harder than applying for a bank loan\n\u2022 Sellers need to be \u201csold\u201d on it\n\u2022 Many sellers will still say no\n\nSo let\u2019s look at 9 ways to increase your odds of seller financing a deal:\n\n1. ALWAYS ASK.\n\nSeller financing isn\u2019t all or nothing. ALWAYS feel out how much the seller will finance. Maybe you only get $300k on a $3M deal. That's $300k not out of YOUR pocket.\n\n2. Relationship Is the Foundation\n\nYour odds of getting financing increase as your rapport with the seller increases.\n\n3. Seller Risk\n\nYou\u2019ll get pushback. Get to the bottom of WHY the seller is hesitant. It\u2019s often not a no, just an \u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d Find out what will make them sure.\n\n4. Your Price, My Terms\n\nSeller wants $250k more for the biz? Alright, then you the buyer get to hold the reigns on the interest rate, length of payback period, and other levers.\n\n5. Presentation\n\nYou are PITCHING a seller, so go back to negotiation 101:\n\u2022 Don\u2019t play all your cards at once\n\u2022 Focus on where the seller\u2019s head is at & what they need to move the deal forward\n\n6. Throwaway Terms\n\nThe seller\u2019s mind is running through worst case scenarios. Most of those scenarios have a .0001% chance of happening, so you can put them in the contract anyway.\n\n7. Fallback Positions\n\nThese are backup terms you don\u2019t want to lead with, but would compromise for.\n\n8. Knowledge vs Wisdom\n\nKeep rebuttals to seller concerns in your back pocket. But don\u2019t just rattle off a bunch of terms and benefits. Understand their fear/concern \u2192 then propose the solution for it\n\n9. Creative Solutions\n\nEvery deal is full of problems. The fun of it is finding creative solutions.\n\nDon't let \"this is the usual way\" stop you from \"this makes me more.\"\n\nRelated:\n\nTOMORROW you can get live teaching from experts + breakout sessions with like-minded people on:\n\n\u2022 Seller financing\n\u2022 Deal clarity\n\u2022 Financial analysis\n\u2022 & the rest of the acquisition process\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Tickets available here (until midnight!): https://lnkd.in/ebZSU7TT",

Their products were designed in a pre-AI world, with pre-AI economics. They have massive teams, expensive infrastructure, and shareholders demanding consistent growth.\n\nAnd more people than ever want to use these products, but they don't want to pay another monthly subscription. \n\nMeanwhile, a small team of vibe coders could band together tomorrow and build 90%+ of the functionality in weeks, not years and offer it for FREE to 99% of users. Thanks to tools like Replit, V0, Cursor, Bolt, Lovable etc and all these open-source models.\n\nAnd instead of charging monthly, you give it out for free, and charge power users per outcome. And you can layer on premium service to cash flow (I can talk about that on another tweet on what I'd do)\n\nWhat's holding people back? Is it the fear of taking on giants? The allure of building something \"new\" instead of \"better\"? Or people just like building on their own so they don't want to band together?\n\nI think the avg customer prefers a one-stop shop for all these free new AI saas powered tools. \n\nYou don't need to raise VC if you don't want to. \n\nEvery time I open one of these legacy products and see the same old interfaces with the same old limitations, I can't help but think we're at the beginning of a massive wealth transfer from incumbents to the teams bold enough to rebuild them from scratch.\n\nI'm not saying these incumbents are going to die btw. But I do think there's an opportunity (yeah a really big one) to peel off some of their sweet saas revenue and monetize it differently. Make it free for most. \n\nNothing people hate more than a monthly subscription. \n\nHappy building.\n\ni've shared 30+ more startup ideas you can steal here https://lnkd.in/dGt8Cch4",

        "full_content": "Are we going to pretend $750/hour law firms are going to be business as usual in the AI age?\n\nI just used Grok Deep Research to draft a simple contract. Took 15 minutes. Would have cost $2,000 with a lawyer. \n\nWhen I sent it to my attorney to review, his response was \"looks good\" 2 days later.\n\nI had already sent the contract lol. It was signed by the client. Thanks Mr. Attorney.\n\nLawyers and accountants keep insisting that AI is just a toy and real work requires human judgment. Meanwhile, their billable hours model is silently imploding.\n\nI've watched this pattern play out before. First comes denial. Then \"it only works for simple stuff.\" Then \"it can't handle nuance.\" Finally, massive restructuring.\n\nLaw firms won't disappear, but the pyramid of junior associates doing document review and contract drafting is evaporating overnight. What nobody's talking about is how the next generation will learn when the entry-level jobs that have always been the training ground are precisely what AI does best.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the biggest shock to law firms comes when their own clients start bringing AI-drafted documents to meetings and just asking for quick reviews. \n\nThe real change won't be dramatic - it'll be the slow realization that clients are paying for 1 hour of work instead of 10, while still getting the same outcome. \n\nIt'll be death by a thousand cuts as more routine legal work gets handled by in-house teams with AI assistance.\n\nWe're watching the complete reinvention of professional services happen in real-time, and pretending nothing will change.",

        "full_content": "5 \u201cbasic\u201d LinkedIn tips that are actually incredibly effective:\n\n1. Write effective hooks\n\nYour hook\u2014the first 10% of your post\u2014decides whether or not people read the last 90% of it.\n\nLike it or not, you\u2019re competing for attention.\n\nIf your hook isn\u2019t interesting, your readers will scroll to something more interesting.\n\n2. Be consistent\n\nPublishing content on LinkedIn consistently is the price of entry\u2014you can\u2019t succeed without it.\n\nThat said, consistency isn\u2019t enough by itself.\n\nYour target needs to be undeniably valuable to a clearly defined target audience who can pay for more of your knowledge.\n\nInterview your target market to learn their pain points. Then, build content pillars around each of those pain points.\n\nResults are inevitable.\n\n3. Respond to your comments\n\nLinkedIn values community much more than any other social media platform\u2014\n\nThis means they want to see authors engaging with their audience (and other industry peers).\n\nCreators who take the time to respond won\u2019t just enjoy greater reach, but deeper audience connections, too.\n\n4. Experiment with different formats\n\nFor most authors, written posts aren\u2019t enough to make the most of LinkedIn anymore\u2026\n\nCarousels tend to get the most reach, while video creates the deepest psychological connections.\n\n(There\u2019s also some evidence LinkedIn is pushing videos more in the feed than it used to)\n\n5. Write for your target audience\n\nStop trying to \u201cgo viral\u201d and \u201cgo value\u201d instead.\n\n10,000,000 views from total strangers are worthless if they\u2019re not interested in your actual expertise as a professional\u2026\n\nSure, a few of them may hit the follow button, but they won\u2019t stick around if you\u2019re just another \u201cinfluencer\u201d handing out dopamine hits.\n\nThe real winners on LinkedIn focus on audience quality.\n\nAll it takes is the right impression on the right people to create high-paying clients (and life-changing results).\n\nThose are some of my favorite \u201cbasic\u201d LinkedIn tips\u2014\n\nWhat are yours?",

The Success-Only Trap\n\nThey look only at what worked, never what failed.\n\nIt\u2019s like studying only lottery winners to understand how to win the lottery.\n\n2. The False Attribution Trap\n\nThey attribute success to things they can control instead of what matters:\n\nSaying something worth paying attention to.\n\n3. The Correlation Confusion\n\nThey mistake correlation for causation.\n\nJust because something happened before success doesn\u2019t mean it caused success.\n\nAnd the truth is, the content format doesn\u2019t matter (much).\n\nWhat drives actual LinkedIn success is\u2026\n\n1. Credibility (Do people trust your expertise?)\n2. Value (Are you saying something worth hearing?)\n3. Clarity (Can people understand your point quickly?)\n4. Luck (Will the algorithm pick it up? Will it show it to the right audience?)\n\nEverything else is just optimization.\n\nI\u2019ve seen too many people chase vanity metrics that lead to zero business results.\n\nBelow, I break down the metrics that matter and how to build real LinkedIn success.\n\nRead my complete guide for the full breakdown on how to cut through the \u201cLinkedIn noise\u201d:\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dJb_ZwSG",

If I don\u2019t throw the starfish back in, they\u2019ll die.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head and said, \"But there's too many starfish on this beach. You can\u2019t possibly make a difference.\"\n\nAfter thinking for a moment, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it into the ocean.\n\nThen, he turned to the old man and said, \"Well, I made a difference to that one.\"\n\nIn your own life and career, it's easy to adopt a negative mindset in the face of a seemingly enormous challenge.\n\nYou're trying to transform your life, but it's impossible to see how the tiny actions today will ever create the change you seek.\n\nIn those moments, remember the little boy from the story:\n\nBend down, pick up a single starfish, and throw it back into the ocean.\n\nYou won't change your life in a day, but if you change your days, you'll eventually change your life.\n\nMy book offers a guide to the tiny actions you can start taking to change your days, so that you can eventually change your life.\n\nIt comes out in exactly one month.

        "full_content": "Subject lines are the hardest type of \"hook\" to write. So I created an AI prompt that makes it 10x easier:\n\nBut first, why is writing great subject lines so hard?\n\nSimple:\n\nBecause you have a such big \u201clength\u201d constraint.\n\n(For context: Ideally, a subject line can only have 40-45 characters.)\n\nAnd the more concise you have to be, the harder it is to write something good - and the more thought it requires.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s 2 \u201chacks\u201d that can make it 10x easier to write a potent subject line:\n\n\u2022 Starting with an already proven hook (so you don\u2019t need to start \u201cfrom scratch)\n\n\u2022 Using an AI tool like Claude or ChatGPT to accelerate your \u201cbrainstorming\u201d process (so you can find the best formats & angles, faster)\n\nSo with this in mind, I created a plug-and-play AI prompt to help you write irresistible subject lines - 10x faster!\n\nAll you need?\n\nA proven Twitter/X or LinkedIn hook.\n\nIt can be yours or it can be someone else\u2019s.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve found it, all you need to do is fill in the prompt below & feed it to your favorite AI tool.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n\"You\u2019re a world-class email copywriter. I want your help turning a viral LinkedIn hook I recently found into an attention-grabbing subject line.\n\nSo, here's what we're going to do:\n\nI'm going to share with you the LinkedIn hook and then I want you to come up with 15 different subject line variations inspired by that hook.\n\nNow, here are a few important guidelines you should follow when brainstorming each subject line variation:\n\n\u2022 The subject line shouldn't have more than 45 characters (including spaces)\n\n\u2022 The subject line needs to be clear (not clever) but also create a \"curiosity gap\" (i.e. We can't give the reader the \"answer.\" Instead we need to give them a reason to want to open the email.)\n\n\u2022 The subject line should be formatted in sentence case (never capitalize the first letter of each word because we don't want our subject lines to read like an article headline).\n\n\u2022 For each subject line variation we come up with, we also need to generate a \"preview text.\" (For context: the \"preview text\" is the copy that shows up right next to or underneath the email subject line on people's inbox, and it acts almost a sub-headline.)\n\n\u2022 The preview text should *complement* NOT repeat the same idea that's being communicated in the subject line. We also want to avoid repeating any words that have already been used in the headline. (Again, we want to use the \"preview text\" as a sub-headline.)\n\n\u2022 Lastly, please structure your output in the following way:\n\n[Heading] Subject Line X\n\n\u2022 Subject line: [insert subject line variation]\n\u2022 Preview text: [insert preview text variation]\n\nSo here you go - here's my LinkedIn hook:\"\n\nPS - Want to get this prompt in a Notion doc?\n\nComment \"prompt\" and I'll send it over (along with another bonus prompt).",

        "full_content": "Why Startup Founders Fail: \n\n(based on my own failures & 100+ founders in my network)\n\n1. Solution looking for a problem.\nFounders build a solution first and then go to users, pitching it and trying to convince them they have such a problem.\n\n2. They like it, but won't pay.\nOften happens to \"vitamin\" products.\n\n3. Failed to monetize b2c.\nOnce, I built an app with over 100k users, and was 1st on App Store with an award. But once I wanted to monetize it, I realized it was impossible to make good money here. \n\n4. Raised VC money for a non-unicorn idea.\nVCs make 100 bets. You're just one of 100. The chance you fail is 99%, because for VCs anything is a failure except unicorns.\nYou could turn it into $10m/year biz in a bootstrapped mode, but VCs will force u to bankrupt such company.\n\n\n5. Wrong cofounder.\nWhen 2 people start a company, and 1 quits, the other one isn't that crazy about working their ass off for this startup to succeed.\nMost startups I know that lost one of their cofounders early failed. I think cofounders bring more risk than upside.\n\n6. Small market.\nIn Norway, where I spent most of my life building my startups, most would first start with a local market.\nI thought it was smart, but the aftermath of the last 15 years shows that it was the reason for the downfall of the Norwegian startup ecosystem.\n\n7. Outsourcing.\nThink of it as hiring someone to raise your child.\nThis is a terrible idea in most cases.\nSame for a startup. The single best predictor for a startup's failure is the fact that they outsource their tech.\nEven worse: they outsource their marketing (before PMF)\n\n8. Building a vitamin, not a painkiller.\nMany founders don't have ideas. So they squeeze the idea out of the air, which often is a vitamin. It makes sense, but people can perfectly live without it.\nA painkiller: u pitch someone & they nag you every week asking for access.\n\n9. No passion for an audience & field.\n\n10. Lack of focus.\nCoding is easy now. I see too many founders jumping from idea to idea every month.\nNothing wrong with it, but for most, it'd make more sense to pivot existing ideas, instead of jumping into new ones.\nIt's best to become an expert in one field.\n\n11. Not using their own product.\n\n12. Not validating.\n\n13. Bet on non organic growth.\n\n14. Didn't plan for a marathon.\n\n15. Out of money.\n\n16. Not willing to learn, fixed on delegating.\nFounders thinking: I'm the General, I'll find people better than me in each position, delegate & we will win cuz that's what Steve Jobs said.\nIn reality, founders must do all important work until PMF. Employees can't handle it.\n\n17. That's it.\nBesides the failures, I\u2019ve built stuff millions use:\n\u21b3 https://lnkd.in/e65ijFNc website & directory builder.\n\u21b3 https://listingbott.com ai agent that lists you on all relevant web directories.\n\u21b3 https://seobotai.com ai agent to run your blog 100% on autopilot.\n\nsee full version on my X",

She began signing applications as \"M. Siebert.\"\n\nThe interviews started flowing in immediately.\n\nHer expertise in aerospace stocks quickly made her indispensable.\n\nThen she discovered male colleagues earned 2x her salary for identical work.\n\nThe only path to equal pay? \nBuy a seat on the NYSE: $445,000 ($4.2M today).\n\nBut Wall Street revealed its true nature:\n\u2022 9 of 10 firms refused to sponsor her application\n\u2022 Banks rejected her without a male signature\n\u2022 NYSE demanded a $300,000 guarantee (never required for men)\n\nAfter 2 years of persistence, Chase Manhattan finally approved her loan.\n\nDecember 28, 1967: Siebert bought her seat, becoming the only woman among 1,365 men.\n\nThen came the real obstacles:\n\u2022 No women's restroom on the trading floor\n\u2022 Barred from men-only clubs where deals happened\n\u2022 Constant pressure to leave\n\nHer response was legendary:\n\u2022 Threatened to install a portable toilet on the floor\n\u2022 Built her own powerful network\n\u2022 Launched one of the first discount brokerages\n\u2022 Became NY's first female Banking Superintendent\n\nUnder her leadership:\n\u2022 Not a single bank failed\n\u2022 She oversaw $500B in assets\n\u2022 First NYSE room named after an individual\n\u2022 Pioneered financial literacy in schools\n\nHer words still resonate:\n\"For 10 years, I was the only woman out of 1,365 men. I didn't speak for two years. How do you talk to people who don't want you there?\"\n\nThe lesson?\n\nSiebert saw value where others saw barriers\n\nJust like the best opportunities aren't where everyone's looking... \n\nThey're where everyone says \"impossible.\"\n\n-\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nI'm Baptiste Parravicini:\n\u2022 Tech entrepreneur & API visionary\n\u2022 Co-founder of apidays, world's leading API conference\n\u2022 Passionate about AI integration & tech for the greater good\n\nWant more on becoming the future of tech? \n\nCheck out the comments \u2b07\ufe0f",

Set. Match.\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting...\n\nFast forward to 2019: These bitter rivals announced a shocking cloud partnership.\n\nWhy?

People realized: If sellers paid to list items, they were probably legitimate.\n\nBut the platform faced a bigger challenge: \nGetting strangers to trust each other online.\n\nThe solution? \n\nA revolutionary feedback system where buyers and sellers could rate each other.\n\nThis became the blueprint for modern e-commerce trust.\n\nIn 2000, they made an even bolder move: Introducing fixed-price listings.\n\nCritics thought it would kill the auction format.\n\nInstead, it exploded growth - today, 90% of items sell through fixed prices.\n\nThe platform's current impact is staggering:\n\u2022 132 million active buyers\n\u2022 Operations in 190 markets\n\u2022 $73 billion in yearly transactions\n\nThe lesson?

Outbound based on lead intent \n\nWhy we needed to change what we do:\n\n- Email deliverability is extremely hard to get right.\n- Lower barrier to entry.\n\nThe Process\n\n1 - Know your ICP and own the data\n\nKnowing exactly who and where your ICP is key. \n\nStart by building a hyper-targeted list of companies or people you would ideally work with. \n\nFrom here, you can proceed without needing an expensive data source. \n\nJust add loads of filters and use Clay AI to find your ICP.\n\n- Apollo.io\n- ListKit\n- Instantly.ai\n- ocean.io\n\n\n2 - Create a modern outbound system\n\n- 50-100 domains.\n- 5-10 emails per domain per day.\n- Only send to Google domains.\n- Short email with no spam words.\n\nOnly reach out to hyper-segmented and targeted lists with a relevant offer and reason to contact. Include trigger-based systems. \n\nUse offsite tools like Vector \ud83d\udc7b to identify in-market leads, then use Clay to process, enrich, and add them to an Instantly.ai campaign.\n\n\n3 - Create a company content system\n\nAuthority and trust are the key differences between someone buying from you or a competitor. \n\nYes, it takes time to be effective, but once it\u2019s there, it\u2019s lasting. This is why big brands thrive. \n\nI recently created a post explaining how you can get yourself and your team to post high-quality content on LinkedIn. \n\nI also suggest creating content for a blog and any other channel your ICP views.\n\n\n4 - Capture and identify demand from your inbound\n\nWe need to identify content viewers in your ICP so we can target them. \n\nTo do this, use a tool like Trigify.io for LinkedIn content. \n\nFor other platforms, use lead magnets to capture contact info, providing value to the marketplace (this only works if the lead magnet is good). \n\nPush these leads to Clay for enrichment.\n\n\n5 - Convert outbound demand\n\nThe same goes for outbound: we need to convert positive replies into meetings or sales.\n\nRule #1: Reply within 15 minutes of receiving a response\u2014this is vital to increase the meeting booking rate. \n\nTrack all replies and send them into a CRM, which you can do with an Instantly.ai + Zapier integration.\n\n------\n\nThis is what is working right now. Make the most of it while you can.\n\nMessage me if you\u2019d like a more in-depth breakdown.",

Then adding the lead into Instantly. \n\n1 - Set up a Vector account.\n2 - Connect to Clay via a webhook.\n3 - In Clay, create a table and select \"Monitor Webhook.\"\n4 - Set up and test enrichments & qualification filters.\n5 - Add a column, search for \"Add lead to Instantly campaign.\"\n6 - Map fields and add extra info for Slack.\n\n\n--- Play 2 \u2192 Ad Click \u2192 Slack ---\n\nVector \ud83d\udc7b \u2192 Clay \u2192 Findymail \u2192 Slack\n\nThis is very similar to the play above.

They aren\u2019t gaming the system - they ARE the system.\n\nHere\u2019s how you do that:\n\n1. Rank on the right platforms NOT Google\n\nEveryone wants to rank #1 on Google, but that\u2019s playing the hardest game with the worst odds.\n\nInstead, find websites that ALREADY rank high on google and list yourself there\n\nThey already own the first page of Google - why fight them when you can use them?\n\nIf you\u2019re a web dev agency in Chicago, don\u2019t waste time trying to rank for \u201cweb development in Chicago.\u201d\n\nOptimize your profile on sites like Clutch or BuiltInChicago (or just pay them to rank at the top)\n\n2. Become the industry leader by showing up everywhere\n\nWhen I first started I wasn\u2019t ranking in search.\n\nBut I started getting on every podcast I could, doing guest appearances, writing case studies.\n\nOver time this didn\u2019t just make me look like an industry leader - I became one.\n\nEvery single podcast will give you a backlink and build up your profile.\n\nAnd more importantly it helps you practice your pitch so you get better every time...\n\n3. Make videos that ANSWER QUESTIONS\n\nPeople think authority comes from some secret SEO formula....\nIt doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt comes from showing up - being the name people recognize in your space\n\nEveryone kept asking me the basics about cold email and finding clients\n\nAt first, I answered every time...\n\nThen I got tired of repeating myself and just started sending them links to my videos.\n\nLater I took it a step further - doing free marketing breakdowns for agencies and posting them.\n\nInstead of waiting for leads, I started cold emailing their CEOs with the breakdowns\n\nOur first six-figure agency client came from one of these. They saw the value, booked a call, and signed up\n\n100k contract just like that. No backlinks needed\n\nIf you want to shortcut this process and dominate your industry without years of trial and error, I\u2019ve laid out everything inside AB Mastermind.\n\nThat's why you get a 1-on-1 with me (14,000 clients, 500k sales meetings booked in the last 6 years, a dozen students with over a million a month in agency rev), plus 30+ hours of courses and 6 calls a week with my best coaches for cold email, LinkedIn, sales, agency growth, and mindset.\n\nGet in here (use the link in my bio)\n\nTalk soon,\nAlex\n\nP.S. A Mastermind client just posted about his 26.67% cold call meeting book rate. If you had the same results, how much would you make?",

Hoping that one big deal will\u00a0finally fix everything\n\u00a0\nI used to think scaling was about grinding harder\n\u00a0\nMore hours. More deals. More hustle.\n\u00a0\nAnd for a while it worked\n\u00a0\nWhen I was working with my\u00a0first boss\u2019s agency\u00a0I wasn\u2019t just another consultant\n\u00a0\nI was their number one sales guy that year\n\u00a0\nI built their entire marketing funnel closed over a million in deals, and landed them a\u00a01.5 million a year client from an RFP\u00a0that no one else wanted to touch\n\u00a0\nAnd then something crazy happened\n\u00a0\nThe calls started rolling in\n\u00a0\nNot for them - for me\n\u00a0\nAgencies were reaching out to the company but not to hire them\n\u00a0\nThey wanted to talk about me\n\u00a0\nOne day my boss pulled me aside and said\n\u00a0\n\"Dude can you stop featuring us so much? I'm getting more calls about you than from my own clients\"\n\u00a0\nLuckily by then we\u2019d already\u00a0closed 600k ARR in 2 months, and had a flood of other success stories to reference\n\u00a0\nThat was the moment I realized something\n\u00a0\nI wasn\u2019t just building businesses - I was creating systems that scaled them\n\u00a0\nI wasn\u2019t chasing leads - my work was making them come to me\n\u00a0\nI didn\u2019t need to sell anymore - our process was so dialed in it did the work for me\n\u00a0\nFast forward to today\n\u00a0\nI only focus on businesses that run lean, print cash, and don\u2019t stress me out\n\u00a0\nAB Mastermind is exactly that\n\u00a0\n* No debt\n* No crazy overhead\n* No stress\n\u00a0\nClients come in every month like clockwork because we\u2019ve built a foolproof system that lands\u00a05-10 high-value deals every single month\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the same system that\u2019s helped a client recently go from a cold start to:\n\u00a0\n* Closing 520k in two months\n* Building an end-to-end sales system\n* Raising 3 million in funding\n* Going for a 10 million Series A\n\u00a0\nHis words - \"Honestly, we could have closed over a million in that time\"\n\u00a0\nThis is what we do in\u00a0AB Mastermind\n\u00a0\nWe take people from grinding to survive to scaling without stress\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re still running your business like this next year - will you still be stuck grinding? Or finally running a business that\u00a0prints cash?\n\u00a0\nThis is your sign that it's time to join 14,000 other happy clients in scaling their agency and making their dreams come true.\n\u00a0\nAre you in? Use the link in my bio to apply.\n\u00a0\nTalk soon,\nAlex\n\u00a0\nP.S. If you\u2019re reading this thinking \"this won\u2019t work for my business\" -\u00a0you\u2019re wrong\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s worked for SaaS founders, agency owners, consultants, and even people just starting out\n\u00a0\nThe difference - they ran the system.\u00a0Apply here\u00a0and let\u2019s get you running it too.\u00a0Let's do this.",

But asking the right questions, at the right time, has taken our ACV from $2K to over $30K for all new opportunities.\n\nHere's the Story:\n\nWe've all been on an intro call.\n\nTalking to a new prospect. With limited information.\n\nTrying to figure it out.\n\nWhy are they here? (Understanding pain & urgency)\n\nIf that is solved, then trying to find...\n\nHow do they actually buy? (Eliminating roadblocks)\n\nMost reps (including myself) focus too much on the first and completely fumble the second.\n\n\n1) The Discovery Phase: Ask Harder Questions\n\nIn the beginning of my selling journey, like many AEs, I was sugarcoating questions like, \u201cDoes this seem interesting?\u201d Instead, get to the real motivation:\n\n\u21b3 \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d (If inbound, don\u2019t assume\u2014make them say it.)\n\u21b3  \"If we could achieve [X], what would that mean for the company?\u201d Follow up: \u201cAnd why is that important?\u201d\n\u21b3 \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for you personally?\u201d (Bonus? Promotion? Job security?)\n\nGoing one level deeper creates urgency. It shifts the conversation from \u201cjust exploring\u201d to \u201cI need this now.\u201d\n\nDoing this well gets them to a \"soft yes\".\n\n\n2) The Next Steps Phase: Stop Chasing, Start Closing\n\nHow many prospects say \u201cthis sounds great\u201d and then disappear? What fixed it for me was these kind of direct questions:\n\n\u21b3 \u201cDo you see anyone internally opposing this?\u201d (Identify silent deal-killers.)\n\u21b3 \u201cAre you the sole decision-maker?\u201d If yes, close them now. If not, ask: \n\u21b3 \u201cWhat does your boss typically care about?\u201d\n\u21b3 \u201cCan we get on a call with them before you pitch internally?\u201d\n\nEliminate all major roadblocks. Give them the tools to sell internally.\n\nWhich is where most new deals get shot down.\n\nGetting in front of after call objections. \n\nHelps both the buyer and the seller.\n\n---\n\nI've learned the best AEs don\u2019t \u201chope\u201d deals close. \n\nThey make sure of it\u2014on the call.\n\nAny good questions I'm missing?

Which maybe is a Cyber Security Intaitive, New CRO being hired, or a New Manufaurting Plant Opening. (It\u2019s really up to you)\n\nThis is awesome because now it\u2019s even easier to go through a prospect list and say \u201chey Cribl had a new CRO on Thursday, let me go say hi.\u201d\n\nThis is the new way of sales\u2026no spamming messages..just being thoughtful and authentic \n\nAt the end of the day, that mission is what gets me up on a Saturday morning to go work on BirdDog because I truely believe this is the future of sales. \n\nI know it sounds corny but it really fires me up.\n\n(P.s see the video below of the Signal Feed)",

This change will allow Noah and I to focus on the multi-seat larger ticket deals that will get us to our 2025 goal.\n\nWe've had a lot of AEs, Founders, and Individuals take us up on our lowest level because it is 'cheap' enough where the time saved/extra deals closed more than make them happy to pay for the platform each month.\n\nThis means finding signals, sending alert emails, discovering decision makers, and doing all the background research to make personalized messaging that \"Wow's\" prospects.\n\nAll that being said....\n\n9 days left, until Noah and I go all in on hunting some big deals.

        "full_content": "97% of CEOs plan to integrate AI, but only 1.7% feel fully prepared.\n\nWhy is there such a big gap between ambition and readiness?\nA new study from Cisco, based on insights from 2,503 CEOs worldwide, reveals what\u2019s holding leaders back\u2014and how they plan to bridge the gap.\n\nKey Findings from the study\n\nPositive Trends\n\u2192\u00a097% of CEOs plan to integrate AI into operations.\n\u2192\u00a080% believe AI will bring major benefits.\n\u2192\u00a096% are securing partnerships to future-proof their networks.\n\u2192\u00a079% say their CTO/CIO plays a critical role in AI adoption.\n\nChallenges\n\u2192\u00a0Only 1.7% of CEOs feel fully prepared for AI implementation.\n\u2192\u00a074% worry knowledge gaps will impact boardroom decisions.\n\u2192\u00a070% fear losing competitive edge due to IT and infrastructure gaps.\n\u2192\u00a058% worry AI adoption struggles will slow business growth.\n\u2192\u00a053% are already losing ground due to underinvestment in technology.\n\n\nMy Call to CEOs: Stop Talking, Start Executing\n\n\u2192\u00a0Start executing as soon as possible. Tomorrow is too late. \nAI isn\u2019t something to plan for \u201csomeday.\u201d It\u2019s already transforming industries. If you don\u2019t act now, you\u2019ll be playing catch-up while others lead.\n\n\u2192\u00a0Start small. \nYou don\u2019t need a massive AI transformation to make an impact. Pick a project that can be executed quickly\u2014something simple but valuable. Test, refine, and build momentum.\n\n\u2192\u00a0Focus on high-impact, low-effort wins first. \nFind the quick wins\u2014process automation, data insights, or AI-driven customer interactions\u2014that deliver immediate value with minimal disruption. These will prove AI\u2019s worth and help secure buy-in for bigger moves.\n\n\u2192\u00a0Upskill your team.\nAI adoption isn\u2019t just about technology\u2014it\u2019s about people. Your team will drive this change, but only if they have the right skills. Invest in AI literacy, training, and experimentation.\n\n\u2192\u00a0Be open to challenges and possible failures. \nAI adoption is a process of learning. Not everything will work immediately, and that\u2019s okay. The companies that succeed are the ones willing to iterate, adapt, and push forward.\n\n\nAI isn\u2019t the future\u2014it\u2019s the present. The winners will be those who do, not just discuss.\n\nWhat\u2019s stopping more CEOs from taking action? Fear? Uncertainty? Lack of leadership?
