If I need ANYTHING fixed, I call my Dad or a handyman.\n\nSo, when the requests started becoming more and more frequent, I said \"Mom, is everything okay?\" I know you know how to change a lightbulb.\n\nShe'd been widowed, completely independent and self sufficient for all of her adult life.\n\nShe told me, 'everything is fine, but when I need something, I know Chris (my husband) or you will come and stay for a visit.'\n\nWe were busy.\n\nI was building a business. Raising 2 kids. Running around with their activities, taking care of my own house, cooking, cleaning, etc..all the things moms do.\n\nSo what did I do?\n\nEvery night when I made dinner, I would make her plate and take it down.\n\nSometimes I'd stay for 15 minutes, sometimes I'd stay for an hour. I did that for years. And suddenly, the handyman requests stopped.\n\nAll she really wanted was our time.\n\nI got a lifetime of stories about my husband (her only child), and the wisdom of a woman who did not have much in the way of worldly posessions, but had so much to give. To share.\n\nShe's been gone for years now, but every night when I am packing up the leftovers, I still feel like I should be putting a plate together for her.\n\nTake the time.\n\nMake the time.\n\nWhether it is for your family or a friend or a neighbor. Because in the end, all we have is each other.\n\nAnd, I scored the top secret family recipes for her famous meatpie.\n\n#resumewriting\n#motherinlaw\n#familia\n#meatpie\n#daysarelong",

Whoever speaks first loses.\n\nThe Better Way -\n\n1. Deliver the price directly with as few words as possible.\n2. Script it out. Yes, write it down.\n3. Practice it 5 times before the conversation.\n\n\"The price is $_____. How does that feel?\"\n\nIt is not...\n\nHow does that look?\n\nIt is not...\n\nHow does that sound?\n\nIt's about their emotions only. And that is the only thing you want to know.\n\nThe best part is nobody can resist answering the question, and their tone will give it away as much as the words they use.\n\nWhatever response you get, you will know exactly where you stand.",

You need to learn how to do this.\n\nYou need help if you can not yet do it yourself.\n\nSo many of you aren\u2019t creative or confident enough with comp plans.\n\nIf you want to get smarter about compensation, surround yourself with folks who are passionate about it and love helping others.\n\nFolks like Devon Hennig, who just dropped a kickass playbook for helping directors, VPs and up negotiate senior comp plans and get as much as possible.\u00a0Folks like Dan Goodman. Heck, maybe even folk like me.\n\nGrab a copy and get smarter about this stuff.\n\nYour bank balance will thank you later.\n\nCheck it: CompensationBible.com",

This small invention revolutionized the construction industry by providing a simple and effective solution for fastening objects to walls made of concrete, brick or other solid materials.\n\nThe Fischer anchor consists of a small plastic cylinder with wings on the outside that expand when inserted into a drilled hole in the wall. This creates a firm and secure anchorage for screws, nails or any other type of fixing.\n\nThis innovation has changed the DIY and construction industry forever by making it much easier and safer to fix objects to walls. Fischer also has numerous other inventions and patents that underline his role as one of the most important German inventors of the 20th century.\n\n#engineering #science #technology",

We only have budget for $200k.\"\n\n\nWe had to bring the focus off price and back to value.\n\nHere's what we said next:\n\n\n\nUS: \"How familiar are you with the business value we're poised to deliver?\"\n\nTHEM: \"I'm familiar. You're going to help us ramp new sellers faster. That's valuable. But not worth $385,000.\"\n\nDead end? Nope.\n\nThen we took it to the next level:\n\n\nUS: \"Can we walk you through the math we did with your CRO to see if it checks out?\"\n\nTHEM: \"Sure.\"\n\nUS: \"Your AE ramp time is 8 months. At month 9, the avg. rep starts producing $60k in ARR/month after 7 months of ramping up. That sound right?\"\n\nTHEM: \"Yep.\"\n\nWe were getting closer:\n\n\nUS: \"Your CRO tells us she's hiring 80 new AEs in the next 12 months.\"\n\nTHEM: \"Mmhmm.\"\n\nUS: \"So if you got 80 new AEs up to speed one month faster each: That's 80 * $60k in ARR = $4.8M.\"\n\nTHEM: *sitting silent*\n\nThen we asked these questions:\n\n\nUS (again): \"The question then becomes, how believable is it that we can cut a month off your ramp time?\"\n\nTHEM *now the CRO chimes in*: \"Very believable. I'm gone deep with them on this.\"\n\nUS: \"So $4.8M expected return against a $385k spend.\"\n\nNow for the nail in the coffin:\n\nUS: \"Usually when we get price resistance, it's either because:\n\n1) you're not sold on the financial value\n\n2) you do not have the ability to spend the cash.\n\nIt feels like we covered #1.\n\nWhat's stopping us from here?\"\n\nThey signed 6 hours later.\n\n\nHere are 3 deal-closing lessons from this deal:\n\n\n1. Get your champion in the negotiation room.\n\nProcurement rarely 'gets' the business value.\n\nGet your champion in the room when it's time to face off with them.\n\nYes, you won't always be able to.\n\nBut shoot your shot and at least ask.\n\nIt will change the tone of the meeting.\n\n\n2. Price resistance comes from 1 of 3 places:\n\nA) Not sold on the value\n\nB) Inability to pay\n\nC) Just trying to get a better deal.\n\nIdentify which one you're up against. Then navigate accordingly.\n\nFor us, it was a combination of 1 & 3.\n\n\n\n3. Negotiating is MUCH easier with rock-solid selling skills.\n\nWe had a few things going for us:\n\n- a committed champion\n- significant business pain\n- quantifiable business value\n\nImagine negotiating without those?\n\nWould have been a nightmare.\n\nThat\u2019s all for today. If this either:\n\nA) Taught you something\n\nB) Inspired you\n\nDrop a \ud83d\udcaf in the comments.\n\nP.S. Tired of inconsistent, unpredictable quota attainment?\n\nHere's a repeatable 5-step SaaS selling system:\n- uncover business pain that money follows\n- generate white hot urgency from thin air\n- sell in an economic meltdown\n\nAchieve repeatable sales success here: https://lnkd.in/gWVp_Vxd",

Non negotiable.\n\nSo if that\u2019s CRM hygiene then you have to hold the line.\n\nSell the rep on why they need to, how it will benefit them in the short term and long term, and also see if there are ways to make it easier.\n\nIf they are a true top performer, and they just suck at all the admin, for the love of god get them a VA.\n\nBut if you\u2019re not willing to fire them over it, pick your battles and move on.\n\nBut if it\u2019s cultural, if they are brining people down. If they are lacking integrity.\n\nThat is a non negotiable in my book and I have gotten rid of a top perform like that and watched TEAM performance improve\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nThis is why I love the group calls because we can go far deeper on topics and get inputs from others as well.\n\nThe TLDR here is\n\nStudy Greatness. Codify it and scale it.\n\nHold the line on non negotiables. Pick your battles.\n\nWe are up to over 50 leaders in the Sales Leadership Accelerator and it\u2019s growing each and every day.\n\nGet in there.\n\nYou might just like it.",

It handles routing, filtering, and load balancing.\n\n2 - Service Registry\nThe service registry contains the details of all the services. The gateway discovers the service using the registry. For example, Consul, Eureka, Zookeeper, etc.\n\n3 - Service Layer\nEach microservices serves a specific business function and can run on multiple instances. These services can be built using frameworks like Spring Boot, NestJS, etc.\n\n4 - Authorization Server\nUsed to secure the microservices and manage identity and access control. Tools like Keycloak, Azure AD, and Okta can help over here.\n\n5 - Data Storage\nDatabases like PostgreSQL and MySQL can store application data generated by the services.\n\n6 - Distributed Caching\nCaching is a great approach for boosting the application performance. Options include caching solutions like Redis, Couchbase, Memcached, etc.\n\n7 - Async Microservices Communication\nUse platforms such as Kafka and RabbitMQ to support async communication between microservices.\n\n8 - Metrics Visualization\nMicroservices can be configured to publish metrics to Prometheus and tools like Grafana can help visualize the metrics.\n\n9 - Log Aggregation and Visualization\nLogs generated by the services are aggregated using Logstash, stored in Elasticsearch, and visualized with Kibana.\n\nOver to you: What else would you add to your production microservice architecture?\n\n\u2013\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get a Free System Design PDF (158 pages): https://bit.ly/3KCnWXq\n\n#systemdesign #coding #interviewtips\n.",

How does VISA/Mastercard make money?\n\nThe diagram below shows the economics of the credit card payment flow.\n\n1. The cardholder pays a merchant $100 to buy a product.\n\n2. The merchant benefits from the use of the credit card with higher sales volume, and needs to compensate the issuer and the card network for providing the payment service. The acquiring bank sets a fee with the merchant, called the \u201c\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e.\u201d\n\n3 - 4. The acquiring bank keeps $0.25 as the \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc29, and $1.75 is paid to the issuing bank as the \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e. The merchant discount fee should cover the interchange fee.\n\nThe interchange fee is set by the card network because it is less efficient for each issuing bank to negotiate fees with each merchant.\n\n5. The card network sets up the \ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c with each bank, which pays the card network for its services every month. For example, VISA charges a 0.11% assessment, plus a $0.0195 usage fee, for every swipe.\n\n6. The cardholder pays the issuing bank for its services.\n\nWhy should the issuing bank be compensated?\n\ud83d\udd39The issuer pays the merchant even if the cardholder fails to pay the issuer.\n\ud83d\udd39The issuer pays the merchant before the cardholder pays the issuer.\n\ud83d\udd39The issuer has other operating costs, including managing customer accounts, providing statements, fraud detection, risk management, clearing & settlement, etc.\n\nOver to you: Does the card network charge the same interchange fee for big merchants as for small merchants?\n\n\u2013\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get a Free System Design PDF (158 pages): https://bit.ly/3KCnWXq\n\n#systemdesign #coding #interviewtips\n.",

They have no interest in fame or going viral.\n.\nI realised that personal branding is diluted because it is so strongly aligned with \"influencers,\" and this is dying in a big way.\n.\nI was watching an interview with the owner of the biggest influencer marketing agency, and he said, \"80% of influencers do not and cannot influence.\"\n.\nHe even said that big brands are now looking for specialists who have an engaged real community and a much smaller following.\n.\nThis is why, for me, thought leadership is the future.\n.\nThought leadership is not about how many followers I have or whether my post will go viral\u2014it's about sharing what I know and my wisdom.\n.\nIt takes away all the do's and don'ts of how to be famous because thought leaders are not chasing that.\n.\nInstead, it attracts the right connections, clients and partners.\n.\n\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc32, \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc1a \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd3-\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc19\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d'\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30 \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b.\u00a0\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30.\n.........",

My dream was to become a pro drummer.\n\nAfter practicing 6 hours a day for years, I got tendinitis in both elbows and permanent scar tissue.\n\nA \"career-ending injury,\" in drummer-speak.\n\nHad no idea what to do next.\n\nMy girlfriend at the time (now my wife) bought me dinner most nights.\n\nI couldn't afford more than Top Ramen (and she had a job).\n\nThen one day (after my car battery died and I couldn't afford a new one) I made a vow:\n\nI was going to become a millionaire by age 30.\n\nI was DONE with living a life of financial scarcity.\n\nI saw that rip apart my parent's marriage, and I was committed to leaving that in my past.\n\nDidn't know how I was going to do it. But didn't care.\n\nI just needed a new \"life dream\" to shoot for.\n\nWhen I told my roommate (now my co-founder) about my new goal, he said something that changed my life:\n\n\"If you want to do well for yourself economically, spend your time getting really, really good at selling.\"\n\nThose words etched a bike path on my brain.\n\nI took them to heart (and I still do).\n\nI went to Barnes and Noble.\n\nBought a book called \"How I Raised Myself From Failure to Success In Selling.\"\n\nTore through it in three days. Mind-spinning with possibility.\n\nAnd soon became obsessed with mastering this thing called \"Sales.\"\n\nFast forward, and a few things happened.\n\nI went from:\n- selling door to door coupon books, to\n- selling home security over the phone, to\n- becoming an SDR at a local tech company, to\n- becoming an AE then RSM at that company, to\n- starting my first ( real) company (and failing), to\n- helping grow Gong from $200k to $200M, to\n- making my first $1,000,000 before age 30, to\n- growing pclub to multi-7 figure ARR in 1 year\n- read 500 books on business in a decade\n\nWhat's the point of me sharing this?\n\nSimple:\n\nFocus on relentless skill acquisition, and your dream life follows.\n\nEveryone thinks it takes several decades to achieve huge things.\n\nAnd sure, a long-term focus is important.\n\nBut the REAL distance between where you are now and where you want to be is not measured in time.\n\nIt's measured in skills.\n\nYour dream life demands that you acquire certain skills.\n\nAcquire those skills faster, and you compress the time it takes to reach your goal.\n\nTony Robbins has a story he tells often:\n\nHe 'mastered' public speaking in a year where it takes others decades.\n\nHow?\n\nAt the beginning of his career, instead of speaking once a week, he'd speak 3x a day to anyone who would listen.\n\nSo he'd get a \"year's\" worth of experience in less than a month.\n\nHe uses that story to make a point:\n\nMastery takes as long as you want it to take.\n\nThe faster your rate of mastery, the shorter the time between you and what you want.\n\nI hope this helps inspires you to realize:\n\nYou're closer than you think.",

It was a windfall, no doubt. But far from the multi-million dollar life-changing sum she'd imagined.\n\nThe fancy sports car and beachfront property she'd dreamed of owning suddenly seemed out of reach.\n\nThis payout would cover her kids' college funds and maybe a down payment on a modest home.\n\nIt was a significant step forward, but not the leap into wealth she'd envisioned.\n\nAs congratulatory messages poured in, Sarah forced a smile. She was grateful, yet couldn't shake a tinge of disappointment. The startup lottery hadn't quite delivered the jackpot she'd hoped for.\n\nShe closed her laptop, heading home to share the bittersweet news with her family. Tomorrow, she'd start planning her next move, wiser about the realities of startup economics and the true value of equity.\n\nThe point of this story is to temper unrealistic expectations and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of equity compensation.\n\nIt's not about belittling a substantial payout, but rather about exposing the gap between common perceptions and the economic realities of startup exits for most employees, even at the executive level.\n\nStartup success doesn't guarantee instant millionaire status for most employees.",

      "LI Template": "How does SSH work?\n.\n.\nSSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used to securely connect to remote machines over an unsecured network. It encrypts the connection and provides various mechanisms for authentication and data transfer.\n\nSSH has two versions: SSH-1 and SSH-2. SSH-2 was standardized by the IETF.\nIt has three main layers: Transport Layer, Authentication Layer, and Connection Layer.\n1. Transport Layer\nThe Transport Layer provides encryption, integrity, and data protection to ensure secure communication between the client and server.\n\n2. Authentication Layer\nThe Authentication Layer verifies the identity of the client to ensure that only authorized users can access the server.\n\n3. Connection Layer\nThe Connection Layer multiplexes the encrypted and authenticated communication into multiple logical channels.\n\n\u2013\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter to get a Free System Design PDF (158 pages): https://bit.ly/3KCnWXq\n\n#systemdesign #coding #interviewtips\n.",

I will work harder than anyone else. I will push myself to practice for many hours every single day. I won't rest until I become a master. How long will it take then?\"\n\nThe teacher considers this new information, smiles, and answers, \"20 years.\"\n\nThe lesson here is simple: When you adopt a mindset of balanced effort, you achieve greater heights.\n\nLife is not about pushing to the max at all times\u2014this is a recipe for burnout and bad results.\n\nBalance your effort, learn to breathe and flow in everything you do.\n\nIf you find that headspace, you will always thrive.\n\nEnjoy this?

Think today on what you're measuring:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Is it impact that genuinely helps others?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Or metrics that compensate for something lacking?\n\n2. A full-bodied thanks to every one of the Accelerator members that have been a part of this wonderful journey:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- We've made millions of $ together over these 200 wks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- We've not celebrated virality nor follower count\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- We've made a community and collaborated\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- And we've learned from each other\n\nHere's to their success!\ud83d\udc4f\n\nBut also, here's to focusing on the right things.\nAfter all, they are what got us to 200 weeks.\n\nWhat are you most proud of focusing on? Why?\n\n--\nPS almost 4 years of this programme has been wonderful\nBut I'm excited to add a new community to it after the summer\ud83d\udc40\n\n#RichTips #network #growth #community",

You winning is a mirror most people can't handle.\n\n2. You'll never look back and wish you made more nameless humans on the internet like you. Never give first-row opinions to those who paid for nosebleed seats.\n\n3. Never take advice from someone who hasn't achieved the thing they're advising about. Listen, sure. But filter advice viciously.\n\n4. Our brains are trained to focus on the negative, aka survive. People question me online all the time \u2014 about my ethnicity, my career, my body. It's all good, it'll happen to you too. Always remember, you're the one doing sh*t not talking sh*t.\n\n5. Choose your f*cks carefully. You\u2019ll never be everything to everyone anyway.\n\n\u2193 \u2193 \u2193\n\nPS: I have a weekly newsletter sharing stories and tips from business owners. Highly recommend to anyone trying to be better \u2192 https://lnkd.in/eYXDrkzT",

It\u2019s called labeling (Chris Voss).\n\nIf you guess wrong, that\u2019s okay. People will correct you. Why?

      "LI Template": "Well... I never thought I would do this, but I just blocked Yann LeCun. Yann is one of the most brilliant AI minds out there, often considered one of the \"grandfathers\" of AI. His work with convolutional neural networks has revolutionized numerous computer and video applications. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend his deep-learning Nature paper with Yoshua Bengio and #GeoffreyHinton titled 'Deep Learning'.\n\nNow, let me explain why I blocked him. Yann and Elon Musk have been publicly sparring on Twitter. While their bickering might seem trivial, it\u2019s disheartening to see such brilliant minds wasting their intellect on petty disputes instead of advancing rockets and AI. However, a particular comment from Yann struck a personal chord with me. Him suggesting that Ketamine damages the brain.\n\nI usually don\u2019t discuss this publicly because it remains somewhat taboo, but I know people whose lives have been profoundly transformed by ketamine treatments. This emerging area of research holds incredible potential to revolutionize how we treat depression and anxiety. For any veterans reading this, we\u2019ve long struggled to find effective treatments for severe PTSD. Many veterans battling PTSD face suicidal ideation, substance abuse, and relationship difficulties. Remarkably, MDMA has been shown to cure PTSD PERMANENTLY after approximately three sessions with a therapist. My sister, in fact, is featured as a therapist in the Netflix MDMA episode of \"How to Change Your Mind,\" link in comments, and I encourage everyone to watch it.\n\nThese therapies are not reaching those in need quickly enough. Public opinions like Yann's, which dismiss these treatments, are naive and actively hinder the progress of powerful solutions that can help countless individuals. If Yann reads this, I hope he takes the time to educate himself further on these therapies. Ketamine treatments, for instance, might help him approach criticism with a calmer, more open-minded perspective. He might level up to a future wiser version of himself. He might even have a new, brilliant idea, that leads to a new AI breakthrough for all us.\n\nThe future of plant medicine is bright, and we must advocate for it. I do not think it is an exaggeration that lives will be lost unnecessarily this year around the world because individuals lacked access to these life changing treatments. Also, perhaps someone who was on the fence and then decided against these treatments after reading posts like his will suffer longer unnecessarily.\n#MentalHealth #PlantMedicine #AI #Innovation #PTSD #Depression #Anxiety #MDMA #KetamineTherapy",
