But it's not just about planting trees.\n\nThey're using advanced techniques like sand fixation, which involves covering the sand with straw checkerboards to prevent it from shifting.\n\nAnd the results? Stunning!\n\nOver 6,000 square kilometers of desert have been transformed. The area is now home to rich vegetation, and wildlife is slowly returning.\n\n\ncredits @ wild heart and xiao luo\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is how we de-risk innovations and investments in one week only:\nhttps://lnkd.in/eq4TvNC4\n\n#innovation #creativity #future #whatinspiresme #innoweek #venturestudio #companybuilder\u00a0#vc\n\nAll rights and credits are reserved to the respective owner(s).\nContact me to add you as a reference or content removal.\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Repost to help your network to bring their ideas to market.\nAnd follow Dipl.-Ing.

Walking meetings are also great.\n\nThere are so many ways to get more exercise throughout your day that the only thing you have to get over is yourself.\n\nDo not sleep on what a few more steps or a bout of intense exercise will do to your brain and body.\n\nIt is the #1 metahabit in the world for a reason.

      "LI Template": "Attitude > Intelligence\n\nOver time, I\u2019ve realised that attitude outweighs intelligence regarding hiring.\n\nHiring motivated people to grow and consistently demonstrate that motivation through action is far more essential.\n\nHere are a few things that can help you bring out the best in candidates before hiring them into the business:\n\n1. Define Desired Attitudes:\nClearly identify the attitudes and behaviours that align with your company\u2019s values and culture.\n\n2. Behavioral Interviews:\nUse behavioural interview questions to assess candidates' attitudes and how they handle various situations.\n\n3. Role-Playing Scenarios:\nIncorporate role-playing exercises in the interview process to see how candidates react in real-world situations.\n\n4. Cultural Fit Assessments:\nInclude assessments or questionnaires designed to evaluate cultural fit and attitude.\n\n5. Peer Interviews:\nHave potential hires meet with team members to gauge how well they fit with the existing team dynamics.\n\n6. Onboarding Programs:\nDevelop onboarding programs that emphasise your company\u2019s values and expected attitudes.\n\n7. Ongoing Training:\nProvide continuous training focused on maintaining and enhancing positive attitudes within the team.\n\n8. Feedback Mechanisms:\nImplement regular feedback mechanisms to reinforce positive behaviours and address any attitude-related issues promptly.\n\n\nBy prioritising attitude over intelligence, managers can build a more resilient, cohesive, and productive team that drives long-term success.\n\n\u267b\ufe0fJonny Tooze",

      "LI Template": "An Igbo proverb is clear - \u201cno man, no matter how wealthy, can prepare enough food for his kinsmen, but if those kinsmen make food for him, he will be unable to consume the whole food\u201d. That proverb is not saying that Dangote cannot feed his kinsmen in Kano. Rather, the proverb is drawing on the strength that comes from unity and the \u201cwisdom of many\u201d.\n\nIn the Igbo nation, parents name their children \u201cIgwebuike\u201d [strength in many] because despite the success of any person, the real strength comes in teamwork. The elders conclude, by saying that no matter how big an iroko tree is, it can never be called a forest because a forest requires having many \u201ctrees\u201d.\n\nThat brings me to the news that the president of Kenya has fired most of his cabinet members: \u201cKenyan President William Ruto has dismissed nearly his entire cabinet in a sweeping move to address public discontent following weeks of anti-government protests.\u201d\n\nRead carefully, Mr. President is still trying to consume what the young people in Kenya have cooked. I wish him good luck; he has a long way to go. Respect his efforts because what is happening in Kenya compounded over years. Yes, those loans have to be serviced - and paid. It is not only Kenya, most sub-Saharan African countries are at the same phase, but Kenya is a little ahead because they missed the borrowing model which Nigeria recently invented: put a long \"cliff period\", shifting the burden to the next government.\n\nGood People, Kenya will have to service those loans and in the next few months, Fitch, S&P, etc will start cutting its credit ratings, and as that happens, the cost of borrowing goes up. The government will react to put a stop gap, and will likely start privatizing government assets and doing financial engineering to \u201cdiscover\u201d money since taxation is a no-go area. Because it does not have crude oil, copper, gold, etc to refinance the loan, huge adjustments will happen. A season of HUGE austerity is here! Nigeria. Kenya. Ghana. And indeed Sub-Saharan Africa is in trouble over loans with nothing to show for them https://lnkd.in/eDQTMkSJ",

      "LI Template": "So there's a vertical SaaS leader at $620 million ARR ... that you probably haven't heard of.\n\nInstructure. They make Canvas, #1 SaaS for schools in U.S.  Your kids probably use it.  You may have used it.   The company IPO'd, went private, IPO'd again, and is looking to go private again.  It's been a bit under the radar.\n\nAnd it's growing 21%, with 40% non-GAAP margins!\n\nThe good and bad?  It has 40% market share\n\n5 Interesting Learnings:\n\n#1.\u00a0 Core Canvas Product Has Hit 38% Market Share in North America\n\nThe good and bad in winning a market.\u00a0 Instructure rocketed from $1m to $100m in just 5 years -- and $200m in just 7 years!  That's the power of vertical SaaS.  But then they began to hit TAM issues after $200m ARR.\n\nBy its calculations, Canvas / Instructure now has 38% market share in North America, way up from an already impressive 14% in 2015.\u00a0 That\u2019s impressive, but also at the point where it gets much harder to grow share.\n\n#2.\u00a0 103% NRR, 93% GRR\n\nCanvas is a sticky product.  Folks don't leave.  They also haven't seen many \"macro\" impacts.\n\n#3.\u00a0 11 Products and Modules, 80% of Customers Use 2 or More Products\n\nA good reminder of the key to being multi-product at scale.  Instructure has gotten good as selling more and more Canvas modules and products to its core customers.\n\n#4.\u00a0 Guiding to 9%-11% Growth Going Forward\n\nLike so many in SaaS today, they\u2019re guiding for lower growth going forward, down to 9%-11% overall, and as low as 5% for their original core product and core North American buyers.\n\nSchools love Canvas.  But as they come up on 50% market share, there's only so many in the U.S. left to sell to.  Growth is slowing to 5% for the core original product.  So they did a large acquisition of an adjacent player, Parchment, to fuel growth.\n\n#5.\u00a0\u00a0Even with Slowing Growth, Will Hit $1B ARR by 2028\n\nThe power of recurring revenue and NRR > 100%.\u00a0 Even with slowing growth, growth still \u2026 happens.\u00a0 Instructure can clearly predict $1B or more of ARR by 2028.\u00a0 With a goal of 40%+ adjusted EBIDTA margins.",

It reckons it can hit revenues of $9bn by the end of 2026.\n\nThat would require revenue growth to accelerate from the 55 percent Revolut expects this year, roughly doubling again over two years.\n\nIf it delivers on its lofty promises, then investors in the latest share sale are not getting a bad deal.\n\nAssuming half the growth needed to meet its 2026 target comes next year, and profitability remains steady, then a $40bn valuation equates to 25 times 2025 earnings.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Wise and Brazilian digital bank Nubank both trade on 22 times 2025 earnings.\n\nRevolut might have to sacrifice profitability to hit promises on the top line.\n\nIt spent \u00a3241mn on advertising and marketing last year, twice what it did in 2022 \u2014 or about \u00a320 per new customer.\n\nThat looks high compared with the estimated \u00a37 per customer that Wise and Nu spent in 2023 (see picture below\ud83d\udc47).\n\n\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00\n\nRevolut is not quite there yet. Its banking licence has been granted under \u201crestrictions\u201d, which is a normal first step as it seeks to meet all the conditions needed to launch as a bank.\n\nOnce the restrictions \u2014 which include a \u00a350,000 total deposits limit \u2014 are lifted and Revolut can operate as a bank, its 9mn UK customers will also be included in the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, meaning deposits of up to \u00a385,000 will be protected if the company were to collapse.\n\nI highly recommend reading the complete Financial Times story about how Revolut finally won the licence to unlock growth in UK (and beyond) and what it means: https://bit.ly/4dgOjxP\n\n\nFind this helpful? [ \ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 ]\nAnything to add about this subject?

Just in case you were wondering if this platform works, in the last 6 months, this is what I've been able to accomplish:\n\n1. 10+ offers to people I met on LinkedIn\n2. 3+ more offers pending\n3. 3+ offers extended and accepted to people for roles I don't recruit for.\n\nThis isn't inclusive of the amount of people I've brought in for interviews so they can showcase their skill set to a Microsoft interviewing panel. Most of my candidates come from LinkedIn and many of them have gotten hired. I acknowledge this is not everyone's story. But, LinkedIn works.

      "LI Template": "Great feedback on the piece on how Nigeria\u2019s neighbours are outsmarting it (case in point: CFA Franc has gained on the Naira by 10x in less than a decade). I understand that many people do not want comparison, and that we must leave Nigeria alone. That is not acceptable on this feed as we will continue our thought-leadership as ordinary citizens.\n\nReading the comments, a key question was: what can Nigeria do? I think we have written extensively on what the nation must do to compete regionally and globally here. My position remains that Nigeria must see this as a process where we go to the root cause of the issues. My points again:\n\nMerit-based system \u2013 no nation has advanced better than its ability to inspire, motivate and reward via merit. Without a nationally transparent merit-based system, Nigeria cannot progress.\nPragmatic Innovation \u2013 focus on what works, over the purity of scoring political goals. The implication is that we have to seek and execute the best ideas irrespective of where they may be coming. Would Nigeria have benefited with a deep seaport in Akwa Ibom over adding another in congested Lagos?\n\nHonest Leadership \u2013 People willingly pay taxes when taxes work in their lives, they say. If we preach one thing and do another thing, you lose the citizens. This is not about having an MBA or being educated in Harvard, the issue is simple: honest leadership. Afterall Winston Churchill, arguably one of the greatest leaders for the British people, did not attend any university! Honest leadership will take corruption to the museum.\nIntegrate Rural and Urban Nigeria \u2013 we need to have a functioning postal service, to bridge the huge gap between rural and urban Nigeria. As that happens, bring a regime of property rights so that dormant assets can work for Nigeria. Those assets include lands, cows, farmlands, goats, cocoa farms, etc. Today, most are outside the balance sheets of banks, and Nigeria. No nation has advanced without fixing its property rights.\n\nYou can read more here https://lnkd.in/ej9fWxun\u00a0and also a longer one with videos here https://lnkd.in/dpGcXAW . Nigeria must work!",

If you give them 30 minutes they'll take 30, if you give them 15 minutes they'll take 15.\n\nI love 7-minute meetings that are normally booked for 30 minutes.\n\nI love 27-minute meetings when they are normally booked for an hour.\n\nPeople are always complaining that they don\u2019t have enough time when in fact they just had 9 meetings on that day that all were wasted by filling the time they scheduled and thus wasting 2-4 hours!",

We\u2019re literally talking about people making 200k salaries and 400k ote's.]\n\nAs Tyler Akers observed: \u201cThe lack of understanding in the comments is palpable.\u201d\n\nThankfully, there were other people who got it.\n\nFolks like Sahil Mansuri, who said, \u201cThere is such a delta between people who understand how to get wealthy vs those who don't.\u201d\n\nAnd Nick Tailor, who said, \u201cYou are correct at the 200k mark. 20k extra will literally work out to nothing on a salary, as you will be taxed 50-53% which is just idiotic.\u201d\n\nAnd Daniel Ward, who added, \u201cI would take 6-12 month severance over $20k in salary every single day, especially if I am making 200k.\u201d\n\nI stand by what I said.\n\nThere is no universe where an extra $500 bucks per paycheck is worth more to Senior level executives than having longer to decide whether to exercise options, improve severance, etc.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m SHOCKED by how many people think execs care about $20k versus the other things.\n\nIt shows me how few people are ready to be executives.\n\nWhat do you think?

      "LI Template": "I'd like to give away gift cards for Starbucks to two people who have been laid off.\n\nEDIT: TEN people get gift cards now thanks to generosity of others. More generosity. Thank you!  Gift cards will be sent later today\n\n\nSimply comment below (DM's may get lost in the sea of scammers) and I'll use a random number generator to choose.\n\nI understand Starbucks isn't a priority when laid off, which is exactly why I chose it.  Because everyone deserves a treat and when you're laid off, especially if you have a family to support, every penny matters.   It's a constant worry.\n\nThe number of posts from laid off workers struggling is staggering. People being evicted, losing their homes, depleting 401K's.\n\nA coffee won't change any of that, but it can make someone smile and feel like others care.\n\nBecause let's be honest, when you're laid off, especially as the months go on, it's incredibly isolating and you start to wonder who is still out there.\n\nBe a good human\n\nPS: Before people start, it's not a scam. There's nothing in this for me, this won't be some viral post and I don't care about likes.  Let's all support those who are struggling and offer to buy a coffee, or just listen, make intros and help.\n\nPPS:  For the last year and a half I have been a career and life coach to working professionals, particularly women who are trying to tame the chaos and figure out how to \"make it work.\"\n\nI've also been helping laid off jobseekers with career coaching for the last 4 years.

What's damaging is when leaders support and perpetuate these bad behaviors.\n\nIf you find high turnover rates - ask yourself, is it them or could it be you?

The onus of change rests with leadership.\n\nLet's create workplaces that empower, not demean, that motivate, not discourage.

How I thought they nailed every aspect of how to build a solid CPG brand over the years. Everything from brand, to story, to products (innovation), to distribution, coupled with market-fit and timing (grain free, use of better cooking oils, etc.), all of it, well executed, year over year. At the same time, it was a bit odd that in the same breath I noted I\u2019ve never tried any of their products. Until now. Just bought a bag as the kids wanted tacos for dinner (yes, it\u2019s coincidentally Taco Tuesday). Well anyway, I\u2019m not a big chip eater, in fact, never eat chips. However, these are fantastic. Really really good product. Again, it\u2019s no wonder they do well, they\u2019re executing at a high level with every point of the business.\n\n#CPG",

In the United States, they run the economy with about 15 ministers (yes, secretaries). I wish the nation good luck as it expands bureaucracy.\n\nA better idea would have been creating an agency within the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, and then deploy more resources into that agency. That will save the new administrative cost this new ministry will trigger.\u00a0 That said, good luck again, Nigeria; anything that works is the best strategy.",

      "LI Template": "It was lyrics for the ages. The Fugees, an American hip hop group in the early 1990s, recorded the masterpiece which connected lovers around the world. The beginnings of the lines were like pains, but the whole meaning of the stanza is a breeze.\n\nStrumming my pain with his fingers\nSinging my life with his words\nKilling me softly with his song\nKilling me softly with his song\nTelling my whole life with his words\nKilling me softly with his song\n\nAcross campuses, pubs and joints, the story was the same: someone was killing someone, softly. Of course, if someone is killing someone, even softly, it was a trajectory of doom. But waiting a little longer to finish the line, the dimples would broaden, and the eyes would roll. It was not really a death path, but an ephemeral passion of humanity where words weaken in ecstasy.\n\nTake it all together, it is a breeze: \u201ca light gentle wind\u201d which is harmless but from afar may be mistaken to be painful. AI is having a breeze. Yes, the breeze is blowing and Intuit, an American SaaS company known for tax software, just presented what is ahead: \"Intuit is laying off about 1,800 workers, or 10% of its workforce, in a strategic shift toward artificial intelligence. The maker of TurboTax will then hire 1,800 new employees\" - LinkedIn News.\n\nWhat a wonderful world: you fire 1,800 people and you hire 1,800 immediately. That song which one Jambite in my room in FUTO, Emeka, nicknamed Tupac, would sing day and night, ended with a line \"That's why we gotta be prepared ...\" People, prepare because AI is here, and careers will be distorted at scale.",

      "LI Template": "I've watched 3,000 discovery calls in the last six years. Here's what I learned about the highest paid salespeople:\n\nTop salespeople get to the \"heart of the problem\" FASTER.\n\nSpeed to uncovering the 'real' business problem matters.\n\nHere's why:\n\nAvg salespeople don't uncover even the tip of the ice berg until late in the call. So they never get beyond the surface.\n\nThey run out of time.\n\nGreat salespeople get to the heart of the matter (without jumping in \"too\" quick) fast.\n\nThat gives them TIME.\n\nTime to uncover the 'need behind the need.'\n\nTime to explore negative impact.\n\nTime to shape the root cause.\n\nHere are four questions (in order) that get to 'the heart of the deal' fast:\n\n\n\n1. Tell me about your biggest challenges when it comes to X?\n\nEasy enough.\n\nJust enough to kickstart the conversation in the right direction.\n\nBut not enough by itself.\n\nCustomers will (almost) always give surface level answers to the first question.\n\n\n\n2. What's going on in the business that's driving [what they shared] to be a priorty.\n\nAsk this, and your customers will CHUCKLE half the time.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you are striking a CHORD when you ask that.\n\nYou're getting to the 'need behind the need.'\n\nThat's where big money lives. Getting closer.\n\n\n\n\n3. What metric is suffering most as a result of that?\n\nAvg sellers struggle to quantify pain.\n\nYou walk into a different world when you go from expressed pain to quantified pain.\n\nYour customer's urgency ramps up.\n\nAnd spending money to solve the problem begins to look REAL good.\n\n\n\n\n4. What's driving you to solve all this now rather than later?\n\nAsk this too early?\n\nAnd the answers will be weak.\n\nBUT...\n\nIf you ask this AFTER those first three questions...\n\nYour customer now has the FULL CONTEXT of the problem top-of-mind.\n\nAnd now... their answers to THIS question will be far, FAR richer.\n\nGive those 4 questions (in order) a try.\n\nP.S. Tired of inconsistent, unpredictable, unrepeatable sales results?\n\nHere's a repeatable 5-step SaaS selling system:\n- uncover business pain that money follows\n- generate white hot urgency from thin air\n- sell in an economic meltdown\n\nAchieve repeatable sales success here: https://lnkd.in/gWVp_Vxd",

Employee happiness, productivity, attention, and engagement were significantly higher when they had the option of working from home.\n\nWFH was a big contributor to work-life balance for a lot of people, as you could lose up to 3-5 hours of your day just commuting to and from work.\n\nDon't even get me started on the price of gas. So it was heartbreaking to see so many employers dig their heels in and essentially tell their employees that\n\n\"The data is lying, you're lying, and we need to be able to micromanage you from a close distance. Productivity and hitting your goals is nothing. We want to monopolize your time.\"\n\nGartner dropping this report just goes to show that when things get better economically and it becomes a more employee-friendly job market, WFH is going to have a major impact on recruitment strategies.\n\nBecause if faced with the choice of working for a great employer who is remote vs. a great employer who requires you to commute 3-5 hours a day in the office.\n\nThe decision is a no-brainer for most people.

I will remember all of it.\n\nMy dad may have given me the nickname Dumbo because of my big ears, but I do have an elephant's memory backed with the pettiness of a Jamaican heritage.\n\nJamaican households have a saying for hard-headed children who insist on not listening to the solid advice from those around them.\n\n\"Who nuh hear must feel\" and a lot of companies are going to Feel it.",

Guess what happens? Dissatisfaction. Toxicity. Disengagement.\n\nTwo months later, the employee leaves the organisation for a better job.\n\nThe recruitment process starts all over again. Leading to more cost, performance gaps within the team and by extension, the whole organisation.\n\nSo the cost the HRP tried saving the organisation creates bigger problems for the organisation.\n\nIn the game of recruitment, retaining talent is the ultimate goal. And to do that, we need to respect their worth and invest in them. If HR truly wishes to be seen as heroes, they should strive to create a win-win scenario from the start. Fair compensation is not just about numbers--it's about respect, value, and mutual growth.\n\nThe lasting impacts far outweigh the initial savings. A truly thriving organization recognizes this. Let's champion for fair pay, not just for the sake of the employees, but for the overall health of the organization.\n\n#talent #hr #humanresources #hiring #leaders #leadership #culture #culturematters #team #teamwork #work #employeeexperience #interviews #humancapital #compensation #linkedin #linkedinconnections #talentnexa #aach",

Find 1 hour to research\n\nPick a time in your week to focus on only doing research.\n\nI suggest doing it on Friday afternoon because you can prepare all your insights for your personalized touches by Monday, and now all you have to do is execute.\n\nGo the extra mile, and people will notice.\n\n2. Time Blocking\n\nIf you don't schedule the time, it won't happen.\n\nPick 1 hour in your day that you will focus on prospecting.\n\n\u2022 Block out the distractions\n\u2022 Have your target list ready\n\u2022 Focus on the task at hand\n\nAn organized schedule gets organized results.\n\n3. Do Your Daily's\n\nProspecting is like working out.\n\nNo one wants to do it, but it will always benefit you when you do it.\n\nIn my Apple Notes, I have a section called Do Your Daily's that looks like this:\n\n\u2022 5 Emails\n\u2022 5 LinkedIn videos\n\u2022 5 LinkedIn voice notes\n\u2022 5 LinkedIn DMs to someone who liked my post\n\nYou can customize this however you want, but you get the point.\n\nIf I follow these actions alone, I know it will lead to a booked meeting.\n\n4. Referrals\n\nCold outbound prospecting can take time.\n\nThat is why I suggest using referrals to build pipeline.\n\nLeverage a Saved Lead List with your Closed Won opportunities and ask them for a referral to someone you want to get in front of. (Post in comments on how to do this)\n\nNow, you are building pipeline that is warm from a qualified source.\n\nWhen you are focused on building pipeline, you never run out of it.\n\nP.S. From 1-4, which technique will you double down on today?",

Done-for-you offers can be a game-changer for B2B SaaS. Daniel's cold email setup offer for ListKit helped rapidly scale the business by creating new cold emailers rather than competing for existing ones.\n\n2. In advertising, clarity trumps creativity. The best-performing ads often simply state what's being offered without trying to be clever or cute.\n\n3. Video sales letters (VSLs) should be structured like a sales call, addressing objections in the order they typically arise. Listening to actual sales calls can help craft effective VSLs.\n\n4. Low-ticket offers can be a powerful way to acquire customers, but the real profit often comes from upsells and backend offers. It's crucial to have a long-term perspective when assessing the profitability of these funnels.\n\n5. Success in business often comes down to persistence. Many entrepreneurs give up too quickly when they don't see immediate results, but significant growth often happens after months of consistent effort.",

All the learnings, tactics, tools, and templates I\u2019ve honed over the last decade\u2026\n\nAll packaged up into what I truly believe is the best, most tactical, and most impactful sales leadership program out there.\n\nThe Sales Leadership Accelerator is officially live and launched.\n\nYa\u2019ll these are the exact trainings, systems, processes I\u2019ve used to build 4 teams over 100 people, 2 unicorns (working on my third) and have trained 1000s of others on as well.\n\nThat's part of what makes this different, is I'm still doing it.\n\nI'm still in the game. I'm still executing on these things, fine tuning, improving, and growing.\n\nThese aren't the tactics that worked 8 years ago, this is the stuff working NOW.\n\nThis has been a passion project of mine for over 3 years.\n\nSales leaders get no training.\n\nIt\u2019s comical.\n\nIt\u2019s sad.\n\nManagers, Directors, VPs, and the like. Get next to no training, no processes, no systems, nothing.\n\nWe're just out here winging it more often than not.\n\nI\u2019ve been on a mission to change that.\n\nThat\u2019s what the Sales Leadership Accelerator is all about.\n\nA program to level up the LEADERS!\n\nLeaders need systems, processes,and skill development too.\n\nThat's what this is all about.\n\nOver 15 hours of leadership training (sorry ya\u2019ll, no micro course here, if you want one of those, go somewhere else! it takes more than 90 min to learn this stuff.\u00a0) That has been incredibly highly reviewed by 100s of sales leaders and companies.\n\nCovering things like\u2026\n\nThe BIPSY Leadership Methodology\nThe WGLL and 4Ds\nHow to run 1x1s\nHow to truly develop skills\nCoaching and Motivation\nTough Conversations and Accountability\nIssue Diagnosis and Metrics\nAnd much more!\n\nPlus over 12 Templates you can take and make your own tomorrow.\n\n1x1s\nCoaching Plans\nIssue Diagnosis Checklists\nCalls Scorecards\nGoal Calculators\nAnd more\n\nPlus monthly group calls, AMAs, and outside experts.\n\nI\u2019ve been blessed to have taught leaders at companies like\n\nHubspot\nPersonio\nDocusign\nSnowflake\nClearwater Analytics\nTalkdesk\nOrum\nAnd many many more.\n\nSo if you are an aspiring or current leader, struggling or crushing, manager or VP. Get in there. I've made it incredibly affordable as well.\n\nIf you're a CEO/CRO - you'll still get a ton of value, but at least get your leaders in there!\n\nYou\u2019re going to love the SLA and I promise it will make you a better leader, which will make your people better in return.\n\nSo excited to launch this and hope to see as many of you as possible on the inside.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eECX6WXE",

Give away free value everyday\n\n- raise your prices, it\u2019s healthy that people can\u2019t afford you. If everyone can afford you, you\u2019re charging too little\n\n- consistency crushes talent.

Specifically, this particular comment has gathered dozens of sub-comments. So, let us go deeper to clarify things.\n\nOriginal Comment: \u201cRemittance is not investment.\u201d\nMy Response: \u201cNoted, but you can remit money and the receiver can invest it.\u00a0 People build houses and the funds are remitted and counted as remittance. So, while it is not an investment in the typical sense, the funds are also invested. That said, in my usage, while it cannot be classified as an asset class in the typical investment framework, when you send money into an economy, you are investing in that economy. That is why cities compete to host sports games because when people come, they help the local economy. If you agree that customers are investors, you can extrapolate that when you sell to that person, that person is investing in your business. So, when diasporas send funds into Nigeria, they\u2019re investing in the Nigerian economy.\u201d\n\nLet me add further with a practical case study: as a PhD student in the Johns Hopkins University, I received multiple scholarships, and when the monies started piling up, I decided to use the funds to start a company in Nigeria. I REMITTED that money from the United States to Nigeria, and hired 13 engineers in Owerri, Imo State. That company today is Intel Corporation\u2019s only Africa programmable microprocessor knowledge partner. Please visit Intel website; it is the only listed company from Africa on that site https://lnkd.in/eBXEraa8 .\n\nThis company is our best business and we support companies across Africa. We have renewed our relationships with Intel many times. That company is a product of remittance and I consider it an investment.\n\nSo, I do not understand this argument that remittance cannot be used, or cannot be an investment, and that when you remit that you cannot be investing in Nigeria.\u00a0 In Tekedia Capital, at least last month, I know dozens of Africans who remitted funds to invest in many startups we funded back home. Yes, they invested in Cybervergent, Meekfi, Flex Finance, HXAfrica, etc.\u00a0 More so, when you remit to pay a kid\u2019s school fees, that is social INVESTMENT. And you are investing in Nigeria even if that is to your family farm. It is offensive to classify IMF loan as an\u201cinvestment\u201d when my INVESTMENT in building Africa\u2019s #1 programmable microprocessor company is not.\u00a0REMIT and INVEST in Africa!\n\nCarl Gandeborn Hilary Unachukwu",

This EV vehicle is powered by Egochain, a permissionless, parallel blockchain protocol, engineered for the African market. The pre-order of this car will open in late August, as we get the factories ready to deepen large scale production in Aba and PHC, Nigeria.\n\nApex 28 is a smart car. As you drive it, you earn carbon credits which are rewarded via Egoras\u2019 native coin which is traded in leading global exchanges. You can cash out those coins in USD or you can use them to shop at Egomart which sells smart refrigerators, kekes, etc also made by Egoras.
