I respect Christians and anyone who chooses to practice their faith.\n\n2. My wife is Indian, and her family follows Hinduism. I\u2019ve spent countless hours learning and appreciating their traditions, and I deeply respect their beliefs.\n\n3. One of my team members, Harris, is from Pakistan. He celebrates Eid, a significant Muslim holiday, and I encourage him to take that time off to be with his family because it\u2019s important to him. I fully support that.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: it doesn\u2019t matter what religion someone follows\u2014or if they follow one at all.\n\nEveryone deserves the right to their own beliefs, and that deserves respect.\n\nIf your immediate reaction to someone referencing religion is judgment, hate, or discomfort, it says more about you than it does about them. \n\nWe all have beliefs. Respect other people\u2019s beliefs.\n\nLearn to process different ideas, even ones you don\u2019t agree with.\n\nIf you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re not someone I want to associate with. \n\nThis space is for people who can think critically, engage meaningfully, and respect others for their own experiences and perspectives.\n\nEven if those beliefs, are different to your own\u2026\n\nAgree?\n\nInspired by @mattlakajev",

Rent Collection: % of rent or flat monthly fee/unit\n2. Maintenance: Either in-house or markup on contractors\n3. Leasing: Fees for finding & screening tenants\n\nThe best operators optimize all three\n\nCoFounders Nik\n@CoFoundersNik\n\u00b7\n10m\nHow Much Can You Make?\nRevenue/Door: $150-$300/month depending on efficiency\n\nProfit Margins: 10-18% (top PMs hit 20%+)\n\nRegional Differences: Coastal markets = higher revenue per door\n\nSweet Spot: 700+ doors = leadership team + owner can step back\n\nCoFounders Nik\n@CoFoundersNik\n\u00b7\n10m\nWhy Do PE Firms Love These?\n- Highly recurring revenue (sticky contracts)\n- No AR issues (Fees come right from rent payments)\n- Lots of efficiencies at scale\n- Low CapEx needs (All CapEx is on the landlord)\n\nThat\u2019s why big firms pay 1.5-2x revenue for PM businesses\n\nCoFounders Nik\n@CoFoundersNik\n\u00b7\n10m\nHow to Start or Buy a PM Business\nFrom scratch:\n- Get a RE broker\u2019s license (required in most states)\n- Market on Google Business Profile, PPC, SEO\n- Build referral partnerships w/ landlords & realtors\n- Use BiggerPockets & REI meetups\n\nBuy one: Look for 100-300 door firms\n\nCoFounders Nik\n@CoFoundersNik\n\u00b7\n10m\nThe Exit Strategy: Build & Sell\nMilestones:\n100 doors = Real business, first employee\n300 doors = $800K+ revenue, valuable asset\n700+ doors = Leadership team, owner can step away\n\nAt 300+ doors, PE firms will buy you for 7-figure exits\n\nCoFounders Nik\n@CoFoundersNik\n\u00b7\n10m\nWant to hear how \n@pslohmann\n built his Property Management business & takes the WHOLE month of June off every year???\n\nListen to the full Episode 111 here:\ud83d\udc49",

She's 10x more successful than me. You make $ through relationships.\n\n2 - Hard work is the only way to get better. Eating sh*t on the daily. That\u2019s how you win.\n\n3 - Fashion matters. People judge you based on how you look. She thought Hormozi looked homeless. Dress well. Respect yourself. \n\n4 - Don\u2019t trust easily. Everyone is out there for themselves. Make them earn it.\n\n5  - Anxiety is only temporary. You can always take on more. Keep going.\n\n6 - We aren\u2019t made of glass. For 6mths she worked 8pm-5am. She didn\u2019t complain. She\u2019s a weapon.\n\n7 - There\u2019s no advantage in telling everyone everything. There\u2019s always an advantage to pretending you know less than you do. Hold your cards close to your chest\n\n8 - Drop your sh*tty friends. They don\u2019t care about you. You know who they are. They\u2019re only bringing you down. \n\n9 - Rest is crucial. You need to slow down, to speed up. \n\n10 - You show love through what you do, not what you say.\n\n11 - Life sucks without having fun. Stop being so serious. Be silly. You\u2019ll feel better.\n\n12 - When you love someone, love them all the way, or don\u2019t love them at all.\n\nIn a world that's always judged me, Tanisha never wavered cheering me on.\n\nThrough the good times and the bad. She's my forever person. And I'm lucky to have her.\n\nInspired by @mattlakajev",

      "Kleo Top Posts": "SBA loans have low default rates, right?\n\nBob sat in his cramped home office, surrounded by stacks of maintenance contracts and crew schedules. \n\nThree years ago, he'd been a rising executive at a Fortune 500 company, pulling in $205,000 a year plus bonuses. \n\nNow he was the proud owner of \"Premium Landscape Solutions\"\u2014purchased with a big ass SBA loan that had seemed like such an obvious move.\n\nSBA loans have low default rates, right?\n\nYoutube made buying a business so OBVIOUS and the business broker had made it sound perfect....an established landscaping company with recurring maintenance contracts, reliable crews, and a strong reputation in an affluent suburb. \n\n\"A steady business with great cash flow,\" he'd read, \"and room to expand into high-end landscape design!\" \n\nThe numbers supported his pitch: Healthy margins, and a seemingly reasonable purchase price. \n\nWith the SBA covering 90%, James only needed to put down $130,000\u2014a fraction of his savings after 10 years in corporate America.\n\nBob already had ideas of other companies he could buy!\n\nHe remembered his wife's concerned expression when he'd explained his plan to \"escape the corporate rat race.\" \n\nShe'd supported him, of course, but her eyes had betrayed her worry. \n\nTheir youngest had just elementary school and she was pregnant with their second. \n\nHer salary had supported everyone while Bob \"pursued his dream\" of being an entrepreneur....\n\n...because SBA loans have low default rates, right?\n\nThe spreadsheets he'd created showed they still could\u2014the business would generate enough income to maintain their lifestyle and then some. \n\nHe'd even used his Six Sigma training to map out process improvements that would boost efficiency by at least 30%.\n\nThen one day - he actually had to run and own the business. \n\nThe people around the transaction evaporated, the business influencer made their $899 on the course, and it was time to start interacting with reality.\n\nReliable crews turned out to mean \"reliable until something better came along.\" \n\nWeather created havoc with scheduling\u2014every rainy day meant lost revenue he could never recover. \n\nEquipment broke down constantly; the previous owner hadn't mentioned that half the mowers were on their last legs, and Bob had never repaired anything in his life.\n\nEach season brought its own challenges: spring's overwhelming demand, summer's brutal heat and crew shortages, fall's race against time to complete projects before winter, and winter's nerve-wracking lull.\n\nHis corporate experience, which he'd thought would give him an edge, often proved a hindrance. \n\nCrews didn't care about his \"strategic vision\" or process optimization initiatives. \n\nThey just wanted their paychecks on time and another few bucks an hour.\n\nHis attempts to implement professional management systems were met with resistance or blank stares. \n\nBob had so many ideas to make thing better. \n\nHe just didn't have the team, cash, or energy to make them happen. \n\nThe business didn't need a former executive; it needed someone who could handle endless equipment repairs, manage weather-dependent scheduling, and deal with increasingly demanding clients who expected country club results on a suburban budget.\n\nThe business wasn't failing\u2014he made his $7,200 monthly loan payment without fail. \n\nBecause SBA loans have low default rates, right?\n\nBut his personal income had dropped to less than a third of his former salary, and he was working 2X as much.\n\nThe crews got paid, the suppliers got paid, the bank got paid, and James got whatever was left over. \n\nThoreau's words haunted him during his long drives between job sites: \n\n\"The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it.\" \n\nAlmost a decade of loan payments stretched ahead of him\u2014seven more years of missed family dinners, canceled vacations, and constant stress about weather forecasts and equipment breakdowns.\n\nHe knew he probably wasn't going to miss a payment, because SBA loans have low default rates, right? He remembers the broker telling him that.\n\nThe worst part wasn't the money or even the hours\u2014it was the creeping realization that he'd traded his life's prime years for a cage of his own design. \n\nHe was stuck in an endless cycle of crew management and customer complaints, too financially committed to walk away, too proud to admit he'd made a mistake, and too exhausted to figure out an exit strategy. \n\nBob's story would never appear in the glowing SBA default statistics that lured him in, yet he paid a devastating price measured not in dollars but in missed bedtime stories, mounting health problems, and the quiet death of his professional dreams. \n\nWhile the brokers, business influencers, and loan officers had made their money and moved on to their next deal, Bob remained trapped in a cage of his own making....too financially committed to escape and too exhausted to find a way out. \n\nIn pursuing the promise of entrepreneurial freedom, he had only succeeded in trading his corporate shackles for a heavier set\u2014ones that bound not just his career, but his health, his family life, and his future to a business that owned him far more than he would ever own it.\n\nBut it's all ok, because SBA loans have low default rates, right?\n\nBe careful out there amigos.",
