      "LI Post": "\u201cWhy do I have to pick a niche? Slack didn\u2019t have to pick a niche!\u201d\u2014 every founder ever.\n\nEvery startup that\u2019s doing something new faces a challenge when moving from risk-tolerant early adopters to risk-averse mainstream buyers. How do I (the founder) convince the latter to take a bet on my small, unproven company?\n\nUnlike early adopters, the early mainstream market wants much more than software. They want:\n\n\u2192 deep support & documentation\n\n\u2192 onboarding, training, change management\n\n\u2192 pre-built integrations\n\n\u2192 partnerships in their industry\n\n\u2192 3rd party support\n\n\u2192 a fleshed-out ecosystem\n\n\u2192 a compelling use case \n\nAll these factors reduce the perceived risk of investing time and energy into a startup. This jump from visionaries (who are happy to shoulder the burden of the above list) to the pragmatists (who are not) has been called the \u201cchasm\u201d\u2014 a concept popularized by Geoffrey Moore.\n\nThe traditional path to winning the hearts of the early majority is by picking a niche segment and simply delivering the \u201cwhole product\u201d for them (i.e. the software and everything from the list above). The reason you can only do this for one niche at a time is because each segment needs a different set of requirements beyond the software itself\u2014 and no small startup can deliver multiple different \u201cwhole products\u201d at once.\n\nExamples of companies that grew from this strategy are Gusto and Square (as you can hear about in an excellent episode of First Round Capital\u2019s In Depth podcast) and Tesla. However, there is another way that companies cross the chasm: they can borrow credibility from millions and millions of passionate users acquired from a more horizontal PLG approach.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to approach a company and say \u201ctake a bet on us\u201d\u2026and another to say \u201c40% of your employees ALREADY use us.\u201d The bottoms-up approach has been used very effectively by companies like Notion, Airtable, and Slack. \n\nThe goal is to get so many users that you\u2019re a household name by the time you approach the majority for more end-to-end adoption. An added benefit \u2014 the passionate community effectively creates the \u201cwhole product\u201d for you (as we see with the countless user-generated templates, trainings, etc. created by Notion and Airtable users).\n\nThis second approach requires:\n\n1. a fast time to value for individual and team users\n\n1. that can adopt the product self-serve\n\n1. and be reached through highly leveraged, viral distribution mechanisms\n\n1. and ultimately lead to millions and millions of users. \n\n#productmarketing #gotomarket #startups\n",

      "LI Post": "I found Meta's 5 criteria for the product sense interview. They're surprising.\n\nLet's break them down: Reminder... this is the interview where they ask questions like: Improve ChatGPT. How would you differentiate Reels from TikTok? What's your fave product? How would you improve it? And why should you care about Meta related to this?\n\nMeta originated product sense interviews back in '08. Their criteria have propagated to the rest of the industry.\n\nI saw similar ones when I worked at Affirm and Apollo. Here's the details:\n\nCriteria 1 \u2014 Understanding the product landscape and motivation. A great product sense interview response actually goes through: \n\nWhat problem are we solving? \n\nWhat business goal is this achieving? \n\nWhat are the competitive alternatives?\n\nSo, your interview framework should give you the opportunity to answer all 3 of these questions.\n\nCriteria 2 \u2014 Determining the audience or people using the product. Product case interviews worship at the altar of the user.\n\nIt's important to not just identify who the user is, but who are the people who matter in the ecosystem?\n\nEG, a common 'gotcha' in marketplace questions is when the interviewee only focuses on one side of the equation. \n\n(Think creators and consumers.)\n\nCriteria 3 \u2014 Identifying and prioritizing the problem. The biggest mistake people who haven't practiced much make is jumping straight into solutions.\n\nThe biggest mistake people who have practiced make is not exploring a variety of problems.\n\nIt's critical to brainstorm several problems, and then prioritize one. \n\nAnd provide a good reason why.\n\nCriteria 4 \u2014 Developing creative and impactful solutions. Once you've narrowed into one problem, you can't just get excited about one awesome solution.\n\nYou need to brainstorm several creative ones\u2014that the interviewer hasn't heard before.\n\nGoing back to the user and business problem can help you think outside the box.\n\nCriteria 5 \u2014 Making intentional design choices. It's counter-intuitive, because the product sense interview and product design interview are often different...\n\nBut you should actually get into some design choices in your product sense interview.\n\nIn fact, a key component of real-world product sense is design. \n\nSo don't cut short your framework or answer.\n\nI know several people who have aced all their interviews except product sense. \n\nAnd they didn't get the offer.\n\nDon't neglect this round.\n",

Something to be avoided.\n\nShelby and I are currently DIYing our first baby's bedroom. He's due in less than 2 months.\n\nShe and I have maintained a breakneck travel schedule the past year between trade shows and setting up distribution. I just got back from international business travel Thursday\u2014I have 4 more trips in the next 4 weeks\u2014and now I'm painting... and having fun doing it.\n\nMy whole life I've worked hard. \n\nBy my senior year I was the fastest high school swimmer in the state of Texas. I studied and swam at Princeton.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, I started Cheers in my dorm room. \n\nPeople always ask: \"Where do you find the motivation?\" \n\nOr: \"How do you find the energy to work so hard?\" \n\nThe answer lies in how I view work... I fundamentally view work as a GOOD THING. \n\nIt's not something to be avoided. \n\nThere is joy in work for its own merit\u2014even if you're not getting paid much\u2014though... that's a nice plus if you can make a good wage doing it!\n\nI'm a Christian, and in Genesis, the Lord calls humankind to essentially 1) procreate and 2) subdue the Earth\u2014and together that is part of their worship and service to God. \n\nThe idea is pretty simple... humankind are inherently workers meant to make things better than they found it.\n\nWhy I don't like the idea of a 'work-life balance' is that it pretty much only ever strikes one direction. \n\nSomeone who works a lot has a 'bad' balance and someone who works less has a 'good' balance. \n\nHave you ever heard someone say: \"I have a bad work-life balance... I work far too little!\"? \ud83e\udd23\n\nI believe working less is the wrong ideal.\n\nI'm not saying all work is fun. Layoffs aren't fun. \n\nShit hitting the fan is not fun. Having to stay up all night fixing someone else's problem isn't fun.\n\nBut what I am saying is that if you can find a way to see work as a blessing in and of itself, you'll really find a lot of joy in your life. \n\nAll the entrepreneurs I meet with love working. They love the challenge.\n\nThey love helping people\u2014customers, employees, vendors, etc.\n\nIn the past month I have met two different groups: 1) Shark Tank alumni, and 2) some of the most successful sellers on Amazon. \n\nIn both groups many of the people there had already made multiple lifetimes worth of money\u2014they had no need to work. \n\nSo why were they working? Why weren't they retiring?\n\nHint... it's not because they want a private plane or yacht... or some other vain thing. \n\nIt's because they find joy in the work they do.\n\nThis Labor Day try to find joy in work. \n\nThat may mean a career switch. \n\nBut it also may just mean taking a different view of the work you do. \n\nEven if you work for a greedy corporation you can find ways to make the lives of your co-workers or customers better. \n\nAnd that gives joy!\n",

The last time I did this, 6-8 years ago, it was challenging to find out what plan I was on and where and how to downgrade or cancel. \n\nThis time, I found it much easier to find my products/services info and get the job done. I wondered if that is thanks to a bunch of consumer activists who forced companies to make it easier for people to cancel etc. subscriptions. \n\nIf so, THANK YOU CONSUMER ACTIVISTS! I downgraded or canceled mostly professional services, including Adobe Creative Cloud, Ancestry, Quickbooks (two different accounts), Mailchimp, Jacquie Lawson ecards, Shipstation, Shopify, Calendly, and LinkedIn. \n\nOn personal front, I downgraded a Spotify and Strava account. Total annual cost (bottom line) savings is about $4000, with zero pain. \n\nThis was purely clean up of items and services I did not need at levels that were not right for me. (Also, I saved another $1000 from changing a monthly fee, but not a subscription fee, so am not counting that in my $4000 total.) \n\nThe three subscription services that have been--perhaps not hard, but not easy--to get info on and figure out how many accounts I have, etc., are Crain's, New York Times, and Patreon. \n\nAll of those are \"media\" accounts. Those three feel to me more like I'm back in 6-8-years-ago-land, struggling to figure out my username and log-in, whether or why I have multiple accounts etc., and needing to set aside a few hours probably, ultimately, to work out how to change those. \n\nAnyhow, it is satisfying to spend no more than 1.5 hrs. to save $4000 without much pain. I recommend :-). \n",

My 30-for-30 Approach  \nDo the thing you're trying to improve at for 30 minutes per day for 30 straight days.  \n\n30 days of effort is a real commitment.  \n\nIf you are half-in, you won\u2019t want to take it on and commit to the 30 days.  \n\n30 minutes per day is short enough that you can mentally take it on.  \n\nPre-start self-intimidation is one of the biggest drivers of stagnation.  \n\n30 days of 30 minutes per day is 900 total minutes of accumulated effort.  \n\nThis will yield surprisingly significant results.  \n\n1. The Two-Day Rule  \nWith whatever habit you're trying to build, never allow yourself to skip more than one day in a row.  \n\nQuoting a study in the European Journal of Social Psychology: \"Missing one opportunity to perform the behaviour did not materially affect the habit formation process.\"  \n\nSkipping one day won't hurt your habit building, as long as you don't skip the next one.  \n\n1. Habit Stacking  \nJames Clear famously pointed out that we execute on Daily Systems most effectively when they are fixed to a time or action that makes them easy to structure and regiment.  \n\nHe calls this Habit Stacking:  \n\u2022 \"I'll journal 30 minutes before bed.\"  \n\u2022 \"I\u2019ll do 25 pushups when I get out of bed.\"  \n\u2022 \"I'll read 30 minutes of my favorite novel while doing cardio.\"  \n\nIt's a simple, effective behavioral trick to execute against Daily Systems.  \n\n1. Minimum Viable Progress  \nNever skip a day, but anything above zero counts.  \n\nHave a goal in mind to do 30 minutes of the action every single day\u2014but if you can\u2019t hit that, just do any tiny amount above zero.  \n\nRemember: Anything above zero compounds!  \n\n\\*\\*\\*If you leverage those four simple models, you will 10x your execution in 2024 and reach new heights.\n",

      "LI Post": "There's a lot of nonsense PM advice out there. Here's the harsh reality: \n\n(Just remember, this job is high variance). It's more important to have massive impact than be liked. \n\nThere's a tendency to want to please people\u2014not just when you begin, even when you join a new team or company. But the way to earn respect and career advancement as a PM has nothing to do with how agreeable you are. \n\nIn fact, some of the best PMs I worked with were so laser focused on impact, it was impossible to get anything on their roadmap. It's not that they were bad teammates. \n\nThey were \"givers\" in the Adam Grant sense. But they didn't make sacrifices when it comes to the roadmap just because: \n\nTheir boss said so. \n\nSomeone is 3 levels above them. \n\nAn entire department thinks it's an obvious idea. \n\nAll PMs need to master the, \"we'll investigate that,\" and avoid, \"we'll build that.\" \n\nMost colleagues don't like that you are the decision maker. \n\nImagine you're a marketer with 15 years of experience selling to this exact buyer. You know their needs inside-out. \n\n\"And this PM doesn't think I know what's best to build?! They hardly have 2 years experience in this industry\u2026\" \n\nThis is how many stakeholders, especially with domain expertise, feel. Meanwhile, designers and engineers are worried about their careers. \n\nThey understand the deciding making power, but they don't like it. \"This affects my career if they get it wrong!\" \n\nEvery PM has to earn their stripes with every stakeholder. \n\nMost PM jobs are 60 hours, not 40. This is the one people are going to have their pitchforks out for in the comments. \n\nI get it. I worked at an amazing, 40-hour a week place: thredUP. \n\nBut, in my other PM jobs, that wasn't the reality for high performers. And that's true with most other PM jobs: Meta, Amazon, fast growing startups\u2026 \n\nYou end up spending the normal 40 hour week on: \n\nSlack. \n\nMeetings. \n\nUrgent Stuff. \n\nThen you spend time outside work actually writing quality documents and emails. \n\nIf PMs go in with the right expectation that this is what it takes to be a high performer, they are much better off.\n\nThe more responsive, the better. This is a hard one to accept. \n\nThe psychological advice tells us, \"don't always be online.\" And for folks struggling with work-life balance, it's hard to hear. \n\nBut, as a PM, being glue is quite important. And you lose your role as reliable glue if you aren't fast. \n\nYou can think of it like two roads: one fast, one slow. You might use the slow one a few times. \n\nBut over time, you'll just switch to always using the fast one. \n\nBatching slack messages to 3 times a day can work for some professions. Nowhere that I worked does it work for PMs. \n\nResponsiveness matters. I know people will be disappointed to hear many of these things. \n\nSound off about how I'm glamorizing overworking, American culture in the comments. But, I did tell you: these are harsh truths.\n",

Here's what I learned: \n\nGlobally, the numbers are pedestrian: \n\n16% of PMs have a portfolio. \n\n61% know of them, but don't have one. \n\n23% have never even heard of one! \n\nBut - the percentage using them is growing steadily. \n\nThe ascent has been accelerated with 3 bumps: \n\nThe dot com era brought many more people into tech, resulting in some competing with portfolios. \n\nThe great financial crisis led to myriad layoffs, prompting struggling PMs to adopt them. \n\nThe ZIRP era led to a huge expansion of the field, driving former designers and engineers to switch and bring along their portfolios. \n\nBut this pick up hasn't been global. \n\nIt has been geographically specific: \n\nAdoption in the Americas is a pedestrian 10%. \n\nIn Europe and Australia, it's nearly double that. \n\nIn Asia and the Middle East, nearly 40% have one. \n\nIn India, EG, many PM job postings even ask for one! \n\nThis got me thinking... \n\nCould a great portfolio help distinguish candidates? \n\nSo, I recruited 5 interested mentees in my Slack community to work with me on a portfolio strategy. \n\nI'll be honest: we had lots of fits and starts along the way. \n\nPeople not reading the portfolios. \n\nPeople actually disliking the portfolios. \n\nOne mentee giving up on the strategy... \n\nBut, ultimately, we've been able to figure it out: \n\nA CS major got an APM gig. \n\nA principal PM finally broke into FAANG. \n\nAn aspiring PM finally secured their first PM role. \n\nA director of Product finally left a toxic manager. \n\nA PM laid off for 11 months got a job again. \n\nThe key? \n\nBuilding a differentiated portfolio that shows not just what you did, but how you did it. \n\nOf course, the portfolio doesn't do all the work. \n\nIt's one piece of the puzzle. \n\nBut in a world where so few use it, it can be a massive differentiator.\n",

Since the acquisition it's generated over 33k in revenue.\n\nHere's why I bought it \ud83d\udc47Acquiring SaaS products is a high risk endeavour. In order to drop that risk I look for specific characteristics in a deal.\n\nBelow are some of the items on my list:\n\n1. B2B --> I've learnt the hard way to avoid B2C\n\n1. Low churn --> Ideally below 3%. It could be as high as 5% if I believe I can drop it.\n\n1. At a minimum 50 paying customers --> Helps validate product-market fit.\n\n1. At least 10 paying customers who have paid for multiple years --> Helps validate product-market fit.\n\n1. No complicated industries --> This includes medical, space, biotech, etc.\n\n1. Simple, mature product --> I want something that does one thing extremely well. \n\nI don't want to have to pour a ton of R&D into the product post acquisition.\n\n1. Built in growth engine --> This is one of the hardest thing to find in a deal. \n\nI want to acquire something which is growing at least 10% a year organically either from strong existing SEO, virality, account expansion, etc.\n\n1. Low operational expenses (AKA high gross margin) --> Most SaaS cost very little to maintain. \n\nIt costs me less than $100 a month to run Meet Slack.\n\n1. Self service (AKA \"low support cost\") --> I don't want to have to run a large support team to assist users. \n\nThe product needs to be easy to use and require little to no account management.\n\n1. Clear way to grow revenue --> Either by investing in marketing, further product development, raising prices, or a combination of the above.\n\n1. 3 - 5X multiple on ARR --> I want to make my money back as soon as possible. \n\nLower churn, a higher ARPU and/or LTV, and the strength of the built in growth engine would increase the multiple.\n\nMeet Slack checks most of these boxes and will generate over $40k in revenue in 2024. This comes to around a 50% return on investment.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post and want to learn more about acquiring SaaS, and how to grow a holding company, then consider subscribing to my personal newsletter - https://lnkd.in/eUjEjjcz.\n",

Sales will sell the right to do business, but CSMs will be responsible for generating the revenue.\n\nAfter all, if customers sign up but don't use it, the deal is worth $0. Comp plans should reflect this for both teams.\n\nCS performance and business contribution are most commonly measured by NRR or GRR - Recurring Revenue. Different KPIs are needed for goal setting and performance management when some or all of the revenue is transactional.\n\nTooling needs to improve in many cases to help CSMs not just understand how customers are using what they bought but to give insights into the rate of consumption relative to the potential. The more they use, the more they pay.\n\nSo the ROI has to be clearer because customers are fundamentally disincentivized from using your product unless they understand the value throughout the term, not just at renewal time. This shared risk model is better for customers but far less sticky for solution providers.\n\nForecasting can be challenging and CSMs will need better training in order to roll up accurate info for their leaders to manage financials. What else will this change? \ud83d\udc47\n",

Talking to revenue leaders every day, this isn't surprising as: \n\n- Pipeline generation has stalled.\n\n- Every deal is scrutinized for ROI. \n\n- NRR has dipped due to seat reduction and change in PMF for many SaaS players.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 - CAC payback has gotten worse (slide 36, picture below). This stat supports the first point. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 - Lean & mean (slide 23). I think this is a good trend: \n\n- Fewer people.\n\n- Lower complexity & costs. \n\n- More focus.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 - Growth rates are down, period! Median growth by ARR: \n\n$5M - $20M: \n\n- 2022: 47%. \n\n- 2023: 35%.\n\n$20M - $50M: \n\n- 2022: 29%. \n\n- 2023: 24%.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 - Revenue efficiency (ARR per FTE) has grown a lot.

Because I took the PLG framework and pointed out three key areas of improvement for founders:\n\nGet your activation rates up as much as you possibly can; data shows there\u2019s a huge gap here for growth (especially for bootstrapped founders).\n\nIncrease your net revenue cohort retentions as high as humanly possible after 12 months (ideally in the 100-120%+ range, but \u201ccomfortable\u201d growth is usually 80%+).\n\nStop guessing when it comes to pricing and monetization because it can easily become the greatest growth lever you have.\n\nBen specifically reacted to the revenue cohort retention reports I had in my presentation, and how most subscription metrics platforms like Stripe, Profitwell, Baremetrics, ChartMogul, etc. have these reports out-of-the-box and ready to use. \n\nAnd yet, few founders and growth leaders know how to actually leverage them for growth.\n\nHe described it as \"cheating\" because he had to pull these charts and crunch the numbers by hand before there were ever solutions that could help him do it automatically. \n\nNet revenue cohort retention (NRR), however, is critical to PLG businesses struggling with growth because it paints the picture of long-term retention (12+ months) rather than just short-term monthly revenue churn.\n\nMost businesses likely have relatively healthy monthly churn (<5%) but when you pull up the net revenue cohort retention report?? \n\n_opera scream_ \ud83d\ude2c \n\nIn my presentation, I explained that growth is really only \"comfortable\" after you reach 80% retention after 12 months. \n\nAnything below is pushing a boulder up a mountain.\n\nBest-in-class SaaS gets 100%+ after 12 months. \n\nReports like these get even better, however, when you segment the data based on specific customer segments.\n\nOne of the attendees came up to me after my talk and said he pulled up his NRR report while I was talking and it completely punched him in the face. \n\nThat's how powerful and illuminating that report is for people.\n\nCheck the comments below for a deeper dive on how to use these reports in your own growth work (and how you, too, can cheat like Ben suggested in the video clip below \ud83d\ude09).\n",

Listing how - even though your house was on fire 3 times this year, your laptop was stolen & scammers cleaned your bank account so you had to work on your Nokia 3310 the whole year, while moonlighting as an Uber driver as the sole breadwinner in your chronically ill family of 13 kids, you managed to hit 7 figures in your solopreneur business, run a triathlon, while also holding a board seat in a Fortune 500 company, and adding 33 new properties to your rental apartment portfolio, but you\u2019re gutted that your side hustle startup failed to invent a cure for brain cancer due to the shortage of VC funding.\n\nWhile I\u2019m crying picking up crisps and my shredded self-esteem off the floor reading 10 variations of the same story every single day, instead of finishing that one thing I just wanted to do before I learned that apparently, everyone on LinkedIn except me is a superhero.\n\nWhy, oh why? Well we all know why.\n\nBut it\u2019s super-annoying. So just stop.\n\n1. Dramatically declaring you\u2019re going on a \u201cLinkedIn sabbatical/detox/cleanse\u201d, only to share 3 posts per day 2 days later.\n\n1. Solopreneurs dunking on FT employees. FT employees dunking on solopreneurs. Employers dunking on everyone.\n\nLike the term of your contract is suddenly a status symbol, sweet mother of Jesus.\n\n1. This one\u2019s for the ladies: The endless onslaught of unrelated selfies. \n\nI only learned to spell \u201cmoisturiser\u201d in my mid-thirties so I really, really can\u2019t beat you to this game.\n\n1. How you use ChatGPT to do every little thing nobody\u2019s interested in & can do 3 x faster without it.\n\n1. Dramatically announcing how you\u2019re going to be off for an entire eternity of 3.75 business days you\u2019ve frivolously decided to afford yourself for the first time in 5 years. \n\nAnd how you\u2019ll spend them on gobbling down lashings of pizza (accompanied by your size 0 selfie) with your numerous friends and family.\n\nBut you will be checking your DMs if it\u2019s _urgent_.\n\nAnd P.S. btw. you\u2019re accepting clients for 2024 - and you have only 2 slots left for your 1:1 discovery call for $297 per hour, and they are filling fast, babe!\n\n1. Saying that SEO is dead.\n\n1. Being rude and calling it \u201cpositioning\u201d.\n\n1. Telling everyone you\u2019ve earned my annual salary pre-tax on selling your ebook in 2 weeks, and then asking for free advice/contribution to your next one in DMs, or worse still - a $297 loan because \u201ceverybody knows it\u2019s been a hard year\u201d.\n\nWould be quite funny if it wasn\u2019t true.\n\n1. Posting unbacked \u201cstats\u201d and ignoring everyone who\u2019s calling you out in the comments.\n\n1. The Beckham meme. I _am_ being honest. It\u2019s like two months old now and memes have the longevity of a sandwich.\n\nTo a better tomorrow, fellow LinkedIn kids. \ud83e\udd42\n",

      "LI Post": "5 Lessons for aspiring newsletter writers:\n\n1. Just get writing\n\nToo many people get hung up on their topic, their niche, and their unreasonably high quality bar. At first, your quality won't be great.\n\nYour content format will be wrong. But you can't improve either without publishing into the world.\n\nMy first format was company deep-dives. That's still something I do, but more like 6x per year - not 1x per week.\n\nThe initial posts seem like they were written by a dumber person with worse writing taste. I cringe when I read them.\n\nBut I needed those reps to cringe less now.\n\n1. Find your tribe\n\nOne of the biggest life hacks across any domain is to get a peer group. I have myself mine - several chat groups of newsletter writers in similar niches.\n\nThese groups are great for understanding I'm not alone. We all get flamed on Reddit.\n\nThey're also great for encouraging me to do what I need to. I would have never monetized the newsletter and gone full-time without the suggestion of Pawel Huryn, for instance.\n\n\"You are the sum of the people closest to you.\" Your tribe makes you who you are.\n\n1. Keep raising the quality bar\n\nAs you get to writing, you should read your old writing regularly. If you can't read it, no one else will.\n\nEverytime I get bored of one of my own pieces and check my phone... I'm happy! Now I know where the readers are dropping off.\n\nMake sure every post you make is better than the last in some way. Publishing is fine and dandy.\n\nBut worthless if you keep making the same mistakes. I've met some writers with 100+ editions and <10K subscribers.\n\nIf that's the case, you need to refine your quality.\n\n1. Write for you\n\nIt's really easy to just follow the market or follow the trends. Certainly, I've made this mistake many times.\n\nRegrettable web3 pieces? Check\n\nOverhyped AI takes? Check\n\nCringe hooks? Check\n\nBut I've been decreasing their frequency. The question I ask myself is: Would I like this myself?\n\nThe skeptical version of me that didn't like newsletters three years ago. The one who thought he was super smart already.\n\nWriting for this past version of me is my crucial check now.\n\n1. Don't abandon the publishing schedule\n\nThe dichotomy of writing is you must continuously raise the bar and write for yourself, but... You need to keep up a regular publishing schedule.\n\nYou can't go full YouTube and go from daily uploading to monthly uploading. Publishing regularly isn't just for your readers, it's also for yourself.\n\nThe job of newsletter writer is an incredibly tough one. And continuously improving gets harder over time.\n\nYou need to assign yourself artificial publishing deadlines to actually push stuff out.\n\nP.S. Want to go deeper? \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gbt3Hk2X\n\n--SUMMARY\n\nHow to grow your newsletter to 90K:\n\n1. Just get writing\n\n1. Create a peer group\n\n1. Keep raising the quality bar\n\n1. Write for you, not for the market\n\n1. Don't abandon the publishing schedule\n",

Agree or disagree? Let me know in the comments below.\n\n#marketing #b2b #sales \n\nSource: Jay Pa via Stage 2 Capital\n",

Schedule one Think Day per quarter. \n\nSpend the entire day thinking. \n\n1. Turn on Grayscale Mode on your phone to improve your focus. \n\n1. To improve at anything, use my 30-for-30 approach. \n\nDo it for 30 minutes per day for 30 straight days. \n\n1. Set labeled alarms on your phone that remind you of the character you need to embody at specific times of day. \n\n1. Color code your calendar according to whether activities were energy creating (green), neutral (yellow), or energy draining (red). \n\nPrioritize energy creating activities and slowly eliminate energy draining activities. \n\n1. Spend more time around the big thinkers in your circle. \n\n1. Set ABC goals for any daily endeavor. \n\nA is your best case, B is your base case, and C is your downside case. \n\nAnything above 0 compounds. \n\n1. Develop a fixed \"power down ritual\" to mark the end of your professional day. \n\n1. Build a deep work practice by blocking 60-minute windows during which you have zero email, messaging, apps, or distractions. \n\n1. Default to 25-minute calls/meetings and take a simple walk during the 5 minutes. \n\n1. Use the Feynman Technique for learning anything new. \n\nIdentify a topic, try to explain it to a 5-year-old, study to fill in knowledge gaps. \n\n1. Default to no. \n\nIf you wouldn't want to do the thing today, don't say yes to doing it a month from now. \n\n1. Use an Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize your tasks. \n\nThe goal is to spend more time on important tasks that further your long-term goals. \n\n1. Batch email and message processing into 1-3 condensed windows during the day. \n\n1. Take a 15-minute tech free walk every single morning. \n\n1. Follow the 80% rule to fight the afternoon lull. \n\nEat to 80% full at lunch and take a short walk to improve mental clarity. \n\n1. To feel energized in the morning, try my 5-5-5-30 Method. \n\nWhen you wake up, do 5 push-ups, 5 squats, 5 lunges, and a 30-second plank. \n\n1. Get cold more often. \n\n11 minutes of weekly cold water immersion has been shown to create immediate physical and mental benefits. \n\n1. If you're struggling to fall asleep, try the 4-7-8 Method. \n\nBreathe in through your nose for a 4-second count, hold your breath for a 7-second count, and exhale for an 8-second count. \n\n1. Do all of your shopping on the outer perimeter of the grocery store. \n\n1. Create an auto direct deposit for a small amount of money into an investment account every month. \n\n1. Automate all simple financial tasks such as paying bills, credit cards, and investing. \n\n1. Make a rule to wait 48 hours before completing any non-essential material purchase. \n\n1. Simplify your life by removing anything that doesn't feel (a) necessary and (b) energy creating. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Enjoy this?

Is that true today and at what stage of growth?\n\nThe answer is it depends - especially on your stage of growth as measured by company revenue. New Go-to-Market motions (PLG) and pricing models (Usage-Based Pricing) are purpose-built to decrease initial customer acquisition friction.\n\nThis, in turn, \"should\" increase expansion ARR as a % of total New/Growth ARR. Based on company size, below are the latest benchmarks on the % of total new growth revenue (ARR) delivered by existing customer expansion:\n\n< $5M = 25% (median)\n\n$5M - $20M = 34% (median)\n\n$20M - $50M = 42% (median)\n\n$50M - $100M = 45% (median)\n\nTotal Population = 33% at median (N = 516)\n\nSome very interesting findings include: \n\nSales-Led Growth models had a higher % of Expansion than PLG models. Note this did not factor in Usage-Based Pricing as a variable.\n\nACV was an important factor in the benchmark findings. \n\nMeasuring \"WHEN\" new ARR ends and expansion ARR begins is a critical variable in calculating several associated metrics beyond expansion ARR %:\n\n- CAC Ratio\n\n- CAC Payback Period\n\n- Net Dollar Retention (Net Revenue Retention)\n\nExpansion ARR as a percentage of total new/growth revenue was the topic of the first episode of SaaS Talk. This is a great listen for anyone considering how to increase expansion ARR and how to measure its financial impact, including revenue growth efficiency.\n\nIf you want to see how Expansion ARR % is impacted by company variables similar to yours, SaaS Benchmarks (with an .ai extension) has the info. \n\n#b2bsaas #benchmarks #metrics\n",

It\u2019s for \u201cpay once\u201d software (formerly known as plain old software.)\n\nWhile the idea of owning, instead of subscribing to, software isn\u2019t new, what Jason Fried at 37signals has done here is some perfectly timed business genius. Because it makes a 60-year-old category sound like a revolution.\n\nOn the heels of B2B SaaS bloat and growing customer frustration over the last 5 years\u2014and a downturn in the economy\u2014Fried came in and proposed a new way: Why pay subscription fees forever when you can pay once and own your software instead? Here\u2019s a bit from their pitch-perfect POV: \n\n\u201cFor nearly two decades, the SaaS model benefitted landlords handsomely. With routine prayers \u2014 and payers \u2014 to the Church of Recurring Revenue, valuations shot to the moon on the backs of businesses subscribed at luxury prices for commodity services they had little control over. \n\nAdd up your SaaS subscriptions last year. You should own that shit by now.\u201d \n\nTheir first \u201cpay once\u201d product is Campfire, a Slack competitor. Dozens of Slack competitors have failed over the years. \n\nWhy? Because, once established, it\u2019s almost impossible to overtake a category leader. \n\nSo 37 Signals competed with Slack by being something Slack could never be. That\u2019s the definition of great strategy. \n\nZig when they zag. Be strong where they're weak. \n\nAnother smart thing 37 Signals did. They used what I call the three levers of differentiation: \n\n- Business model\n- Product\n- Marketing.\n\nBy differentiating in all three dimensions, their customer is way more likely to consider their pitch. \n\nHere\u2019s how they differentiated in each area: \n\nBusiness Model \u21b3 Pay once instead of forever. \n\nProduct \u21b3 Campfire: simple, no-BS business messaging. Like Slack without all the feature creep (and you own it). \n\nMarketing \u21b3 Direct, honest, founder-led marketing. \n\nBecause they have these three levers working together, it gives way more credibility to the idea that Campfire is categorically different than Slack. \n\nThat \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude26 is what makes customers pay attention to their pitch. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that some Slack customers could save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by switching to Campfire. \n\nThat\u2019s a pretty good pitch. \n\nStill, a small software company competing with Salesforce and Microsoft usually ends badly. \n\nDo you think they\u2019ll succeed? I do.\n",

The \"golden rule\" is LTV > CAC.  \n\nSuppose you get the 50% growth you wanted, and you now acquire 1,500 customers monthly at a $75 CAC. Assume for simplicity that your LTV remains $100 (weak assumption).  \n\nAs your LTV > CAC, you are still creating value, right? Wrong!  \n\nYou are actually destroying value, as your mCAC > LTV. Here is the proof:  \n\nmCAC = [(new volume x new CAC) - (old volume x old CAC)] / (new volume - old volume) = [(1,500 x 75) - (1,000 x 50)] / (1,500 - 1,000) = $125.  \n\nThis means that you are now acquiring 500 new customers monthly at a loss, and you were better off remaining smaller.  \n\nMy \"golden rule\": To maximize absolute value created, keep growing until mCAC = mLTV.  \n\nI know 10 CMOs who don't look at this metric, you?  \n\n#growthmarketing #customereconomics #performancemarketing #ltv #cac\n",

Ship a 10x better product. \n\nSalesforce changed the game by offering software that lived in the cloud rather than in on-premise servers (like Siebel, the 800 pound gorilla) and could be accessed from anywhere with a web browser. \n\n1.

Serve an underserved segment. \n\nReverb took on eBay (a huge player at the time) by focusing their entire marketplace on musicians and audio engineers \u2014 rather than staying horizontal for anyone selling anything. \n\nThe REAL competitive advantage comes from using multiple of these weapons at the same time (as most\u2014if not all\u2014the startups below did). \n\n#productmarketing #saas #gotomarket #startups\n",

In a recent debate with a dear friend from a large corporation, I argued that these Gens are adamant about their priorities.\n\nThey will not go after larger monetary compensation at the account of their preferences. This isn't speculation.\n\nNumerous studies and surveys support this shift in priorities: \n\n1. Research from Deloitte titled \u201c2023 Gen Z and Millennial Survey\u201d says 77% of Gen Zs and 75% of millennials who are currently in remote or hybrid roles would consider looking for a new job if their employer asked them to work on-site full-time. \n\n1. The same report shows that the majority of Millennials would give away high pay for improved work-life balance. \n\nThey look for positions with a purpose and a company that aligns with their values but not necessarily high-paying positions.\n\n1. When asked about the factors that most influenced the decision to accept a job offer, 65% voted for personal development vs 21% for salary (source: PWC report Millennials at work reshaping the workplace). \n\nThe above is not just a trend! These are facts that are redefining the workplace in fundamental ways.\n\nCompanies need to adapt to these changes in the newest workforce generations to report tangible benefits. \n\nThese include enhanced employee satisfaction, lower turnover, and greater innovation which are essential to survival in the current market dynamics.\n\nNB.

Companies adopting this approach are experiencing a three to fourfold increase compared to the S&P 500 in the past 12 years.  \n\nHowever, as the prevalence of subscription licensing has surged, a noticeable disparity has emerged between providers' profits and the outcomes experienced by customers. Despite the apparent success of the subscription model, a closer examination reveals that software is not becoming more cost-effective or providing broader and deeper functionalities for customers.  \n\nMajor players such as Meta, Netflix, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and Salesforce have recently announced substantial price hikes. These increases reach up to 24% for specific products or services.  \n\nConcurrently, the tech industry is witnessing a new wave of layoffs. The supposed advantages of economies of scope and scale seem to have gone awry, leaving business customers to bear the monthly cost burden.  \n\nLong-term success in the market hinges on enhancing the productivity, agility, and bottom lines of business customers.

Onboarding begins on the website. \n\n- Miro has compelling messaging (\"take ideas from better to best\"). \n\n- They build trust with social proof (\"based on 5,149+ reviews\"). \n\n- You start building familiarity with the product through product images across desktop, mobile, and presentation-ready devices. \n\n^All of this gets people inspired and motivated to put in the work. \n\n1. Nudges folks to sign up with a work email, but doesn't require it. \n\n- \"We recommend using your work email -- it keeps work and life separate.\" \n\n- This positions Miro as a business-grade product. \n\n- Why should you care? Business sign-ups are >>> freemail/Gmail sign-ups, but you may not want to entirely shut off the ability to sign up with a freemail domain (especially if you sell to developers). \n\n1. There's no blank slate. \n\n- The app comes pre-populated with recommended Miro boards. \n\n- These templates include templates sourced from the Miroverse community, adding social proof. \n\n- Template recommendations are personalized to different use cases. \n\n1. It's obvious what to do next. \n\n- Miro doesn't have excessive in-product tours or pop-ups. \n\n- It doesn't need them; the whole experience is extremely intuitive without it. \n\nWhat else did I miss? \n\n--- \n\n\ud83c\udf81 Even more impressive than the tactics is Miro's _approach_ to evolving user onboarding over time. \n\nGo behind-the-scenes with Head of Growth Design Kate Syuma: https://lnkd.in/eQM8j99Z \n\n#product #ux #plg #growth \n",

Maja Voje and I studied 12 leading B2B SaaS companies. \n\n(Including interviews with their teams) Here's what we learned: PLG is eating the world. \n\n80% of the companies in our study employ PLG in some fashion. \n\nEven enterprise companies like Snowflake and Salesforce are adding free trials & freemium.\n\nIt's the new normal. \n\nWhy is this working for them? \n\nIn 2024, the best marketing is often your product. \n\nUsers rarely want to lock in a $500K+ contract without trying the product first. \n\nBut you do need to layer on a strong product-led sales motion to make enterprise work. \n\nDominate one at first, then layer on many. \n\nEvery company we studied got one GTM motion massively right. \n\nAnd, in each case, they still use that GTM motion in some form today. \n\nBut, they layer on other motions over time. \n\nThe ideal way to layer is symbiotically: \n\nABM couples nicely with outbound. \n\nInbound supports outbound. \n\nPartnerships amplify PLG. \n\nFor instance: Dropbox grew at first massively on referrals. \n\nNow, other channels are much more important. \n\nABM and Outbound are pillars of enterprise. \n\nFor 5- and 6-figure deals, it's difficult to rely on inbound or PLG alone. \n\nThe buyer is used to a different process. \n\nThey want to be hand-held. \n\nThis is where motions like ABM and outbound shine. \n\nThat's why you still see the Snowflake's and Salesforce's of the world focusing on them. \n\nThey're the bread and butter of enterprise. \n\nSo\u2026 bringing it all together, here's where to start based on your buyer. \n\nIf you're selling to consumers or prosumers: \n\nLean into PLG, community, and partnerships early on. \n\nLayer in paid marketing as you find product-market fit and have budget to scale. \n\nIf you're selling to SMBs: \n\nBlend inbound and outbound motions to build awareness and relationships. \n\nPaid digital can accelerate pipeline generation as you dial in your ICP. \n\nIf you're selling to enterprises: \n\nFocus on targeted ABM and partner ecosystems. \n\nInbound is great for air cover, but outbound is crucial for landing large accounts. \n\nIf you have a complex or technical product: \n\nMake sure you have developer docs, free tooling, and community support from day one. \n\nDon't underrate channels like partnerships & paid digital; they can still be crucial support. \n\nAnd above all: \n\nRemember what works at one stage may not work another. \n\nRemember the law of diminishing returns. \n\nBe willing to pivot when necessary.\n",

He would seclude himself in a remote location, close all communication, and spend an entire week dedicated to reading, learning, and thinking.\n\nThe radical approach became a core part of his process: \"Think Week is a time when I can be creative and push my own thinking. It's a time to step outside the day-to-day demands of my job and really focus on the big picture.\" - Bill Gates\n\nI first read about the Think Week years ago and immediately knew I wanted to give it a shot. I knew I didn't have an entire week to dedicate to it (early career demands, family priorities, etc.), but I figured I could adapt something with a similar vision.\n\nThe Think Day was my creation:  \nPick one day each month (or quarter) to step back from your day-to-day professional demands.  \n\n\u2022 Seclude yourself (mentally or physically)  \n\n\u2022 Shut off notifications on your devices  \n\n\u2022 Put up an out-of-office response  \n\nThe goal is to create space to spend the entire day reading, learning, journaling, and THINKING. By doing this, you create the free time to zoom out, open your mind, and think creatively about the bigger picture.\n\nMy essential tools for the Think Day:  \n\u2022 Journal and pen  \n\n\u2022 Books/articles I've been wanting to read  \n\n\u2022 Secluded location (at home, Airbnb, or outside)  \n\n\u2022 Thinking question prompts to spark my mind  \n\n6 thinking question prompts I've found useful:  \n\n1. How can you do less, but better?  \n\n1. Are you hunting antelope (big important problems) or field mice (small urgent problems)?  \n\n1. What are your strongest beliefs? What would it take for you to change your mind on them?  \n\n1. What are a few things that you know now that you wish you knew 5 years ago?  \n\n1. What actions were you engaged in 5 years ago that you cringe at today? What actions are you engaged in today that you will cringe at in 5 years?  \n\n1. What would your 80-year-old self say about your decisions today?  \n\nI aim for an 8-hour window (typical 9-5 day) split into 60-minute focus blocks with walks in between. The walks open your mind to more creative thinking (don't neglect them!).\n\nYou have to slow down to speed up. In a world obsessed with speed, the benefits of slowing down are extensive:  \n\n\u2022 Restore energy  \n\n\u2022 Notice things you missed  \n\n\u2022 Be more deliberate with action  \n\n\u2022 Focus on the highest leverage opportunities  \n\nThe Think Day can be a secret weapon for you in 2024. Give it a shot and let me know what you think.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Enjoy this?

      "LI Post": "For a company founded in '93, Nvidia's ascent to $2.7T market cap has been FAST. But what really is Nvidia's moat? Let's break it down.\n\nPART 1 \u2014 SOFTWARE\n\nThe story starts all the way back in the early 2000s. That's when Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, and his team were out meeting researchers using their products.\n\nMost researchers were hacking graphics packages to run complex parallel compute tasks. It was not ideal. \n\nTo say the least. So, when the Nvidia team met Ian Buck, who had the vision of running general purpose programming languages on GPUs, they funded his Ph.D. \n\nAfter graduation, Ian came to Nvidia to commercialize the tech. Two years later, in 2006, Nvidia released CUDA.\n\nCompute Unified Device Architecture. CUDA made all those parallelization hacks the researchers were doing available to everyone.\n\nOver time, CUDA became the default choice for researchers. CUDA allowed accessible customization of the low-level hardware.\n\nSo developers loved it. Nowadays, when startups like MosaicML evaluate the available technology vs CUDA, they inevitably choose CUDA.\n\nThe ecosystem around CUDA has grown so robust that its lead is virtually unbeatable. This software layer is at the core of Nvidia's moat.\n\nPART 2 \u2014 HARDWARE\n\nThe other side of Nvidia's moat is hardware. But it's not graphics cards for crypto and gaming.\n\nThe hardware that matters is AI supercomputers. The story of these supercomputers begins in the late 2000s. \n\nAs Nvidia was developing CUDA, Jensen asked the team to build a supercomputer to help him build better chips. The result was a massive supercomputer that weighed 100 pounds and strung together many GPUs with world-class networking for ultra-fast computing.\n\nIn the early 2010s, Jensen gave a talk at a conference about this AI supercomputer. Elon Musk got wind of it and said, \"I want one.\" \n\nSo, in 2016, Jensen actually donated one to Elon Musk's relatively unknown nonprofit, OpenAI. He hand delivered it, and there's photographic proof.\n\nOpenAI quickly learned the supercomputer worked really well. Especially for training large neural networks. \n\nThat 2016 Pascal architecture delivered an impressive 19 TFLOPS of FP16 operations. That's 19 trillion floating point operations per second. \n\nIt's a massive amount. But that was just the beginning.\n\nSince then, Jensen and the Nvidia team have been lapping the industry in delivering more TFLOPS, growing them at an exponential rate. \n\nThe latest Blackwell architecture delivers a massive 5000 TFLOPS. That's >260x AI computer in 8 years.\n\nAnd it sells for more than $75K. But buyers like Meta, OpenAI, Google, and Amazon just can't get enough, as their internal ASICs are nowhere near Nvidia's level.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's profits and market cap continue to soar, cementing its position as a leader in the AI hardware and software space.\n",

      "LI Post": "It's never been more exciting to start an AI startup. But the graveyard is vast. \n\nHere's what not to do: Spencer Shulem and I studied dozens of AI startup failures and successes. This is what we learned: \n\nFalling for shiny object syndrome. When a shiny new model or tech drops, it's tempting to pursue it. \n\nFor example, Argo AI raised billions of dollars to build self-driving tech. But after 6 years, the company realized the tech wasn't ready for public roads. \n\nNow, it's gone. Successful startups stay laser-focused on their target user and use case. \n\nFor example, Anthropic has been working on its constitutional AI technology for years, despite many flashy new approaches emerging. \n\nThat focus allowed them to make (one of) the best LLM(s) out there. \n\n\"It works in the lab.\" Turning prototypes into products takes massive investments. \n\nDon't make the Rabbit/Humane mistake: they had good demos and commercials, but the AI devices didn't live up to the hype in the real world. \n\nNow, both are headed to the graveyard. Successful AI startups make demos replicable in reality. \n\nFor instance, Cohere spent two years building a robust serving platform. \n\nThis foundational work enabled their self-serve API to reliably handle billions of requests from day 1. \n\nIrresponsible deployment. In the rush to market, many AI product teams fail to put adequate safeguards in place. \n\nTake Clearview AI. They scraped hundreds of millions of social media photos without consent. \n\nWhen the NYT exposed it, they got banned from selling to companies and folded. \n\nOn the other hand, teams like those at Perplexity AI pay especially close attention to Red Teaming. \n\nTheir vigilance has allowed them to take share from Google, whose AI search has myriad examples of irresponsible outputs (like recommending the depressed to jump off a bridge). \n\nPrioritizing flash over function. Many failed AI startups churn out flashy demos that generate reams of press, but don't solve real problems. \n\nRemember Quixey? Their demos touted a deep learning-powered \"search engine for apps.\" \n\nNow, they don't exist. Successful startups like video AI tool Runway laser-focused on their users' gnarliest problems. \n\nThey went deep on discovery with video creators to find the workflows that burn hours and dollars. \n\nThen, they cut the time & cost by 10x. \n\nRaising too much, too fast. VC can seem necessary as an AI founder. \n\nBut have you heard the stories of Olive AI or Inflection? Each raised a billion or more without achieving product-market fit. \n\nNow, they barely exist. On the other hand, successful startups like Cohere bootstrapped for 2 years before raising a $40M Series A. \n\nThis allowed them to deeply validate their self-serve model and hit $1M ARR before taking on VC. \n\nWith strong fundamentals in place, they could then scale with confidence.\n",
