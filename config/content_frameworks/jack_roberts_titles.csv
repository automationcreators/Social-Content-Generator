This powerful system combines AI voice technology, no-code automation tools, and your existing CRM to provide a seamless booking experience for your business.   Whether you want to implement this in your own business or offer it as a service to clients, this step-by-step tutorial will show you exactly how to build and deploy your AI appointment setter.  Costs 💷 🔮 Make: FREE up to 1,000 operations 🦸‍♂️ AI voice agent: $0.58 per minute ⚡️ Zapier: Free for 100 tasks (£16.44 pm for first plan) 🤖 OpenAI: circa $0.02 per flow 📈 Airtable: Free for 1,000 records   🤖 What it does: • Creates a fully automated AI agent that can handle inbound calls 24/7 to book appointments or capture lead information   • The AI has natural conversations with callers to determine their needs, book appointments if appropriate, and collect contact details  • Appointment and lead information gets automatically added to a CRM and other systems for tracking and follow-up  📝 How to do it: Sign up for  Synthflow (or voice agent of choice) and create a new AI voice agent, configuring the voice, scripts, scheduling options, and phone number.   Set up a new Zapier zap that is triggered when a Synthflow phone call completes. Have it send the call data to Make via webhook.  In Make, use the webhook data to extract the call transcript. Feed this into OpenAI GPT models to analyze and extract the caller's name, reason for calling, appointment booking status, and any other key details.  Still in Make, create steps to add the extracted data to your CRM (like HubSpot) and, optionally, Airtable. Configure the field mapping as needed.   If an appointment was booked on the call, have Make add it to your calendar via the scheduling tool you connected, like Cal.com.  Activate the Make scenario and Zapier Zap. Test the end-to-end flow by calling the phone number and having a sample conversation with the AI.   Verify the automation ran properly by checking the CRM, Airtable, and calendar to make sure the appointment and lead data came through correctly.  Put the AI agent into production use by connecting the phone number to your other marketing. The automated system will now be able to take calls, book appointments, and capture leads 24/7 without human intervention.  🌟 Why do this  Enables 24/7 appointment booking and lead capture without human agents  Appointment data automatically syncs to your calendar tools Lead info gets stored in your CRM for tracking and follow-up Can be used for inbound marketing or outbound cold calling  Highly customizable to match your brand voice and booking flow Saves significant time and money versus human agents Provides analytics on calls to improve scripts and performance over time",31:24,public,5/10/2024,"appointment setting, ai appointment setter, ai automation agency, ai, ai automation, zapier, make, chatgpt, gpt4, ai tool, artificial intelligence, jack roberts, no code, marketing, ai breakthroughs, AI COLD CALL, COLD CALLING, AI CALLER, VOIP, AI AUTOMATION AGENCY",39.47251451977834,9137,253,39,6,536,6,2

I use LinkedIn as an example, but the same applies to any social media site.  The automation has two parts:  1) Creation 💎  It uses Perplexity AI to transcribe the article, then sends it to a custom social media agent I built in Open AI to craft a compelling post with hashtags and a call-to-action, tailored to the specific platform. You can review and edit the post in a Google Sheet before approving.  2) Posting 🎬 Once approved, it generates a stylized image for the post using DALL-E and the article content. Finally, it automatically posts the text and image to your social media profile. I walk through the entire process of setting up the Google Sheet, connecting and configuring Make.com (formerly Integromat), building the custom social media agent, and testing the automation end-to-end. I also provide access to all the prompts, agents, blueprints and scenarios covered in the video.

It can take a sentence or a few words you provide, do thorough research on the topic by running it through multiple GPT agents, and give you a well-formatted output with the research findings.  I walk through the Make AI setup step-by-step and provide all the necessary GPT prompts and resources for free. The only things you need are access to Make.com for no-code automation, Perplexity AI for the research agent, GPT-4 access on the OpenAI platform for the GPT agents, and the Perplexity AI plugin.  The process works by triggering the Make automation via a Slack message. This gets fed into the Perplexity AI agent which does comprehensive research on the topic. The Perplexity output then goes to the first GPT agent, the ""ideas bot"", which crafts the researched idea into an engaging format.  Next, it goes to the second GPT agent, the ""critique bot"", which analyzes the strengths, weaknesses and ways to improve the GPT output from the ideas bot. Finally, the critiqued GPT-4 output gets sent to a Google Doc.  I demonstrate the power of this Make AI brain automation by showing how it can take a simple prompt like ""making chocolate bananas"" and generate a detailed, insightful GPT-4 analysis on the topic in a nicely formatted doc, all by itself.  I explain how you can customize the GPT prompts and desired outputs for your specific use case. The potential Make AI applications are vast, from helping people land jobs to many other domains.

I provide context about the leak, noting the buzz surrounding Udio despite posts about it being repeatedly deleted on social media platforms. Users have been raving about Udio's ability to generate music that's nearly indistinguishable from human-created songs.  To demonstrate Udio's capabilities, I play two examples of its generated music, showcasing the software's ability to create songs with diverse styles and impressive expressiveness. The first song has a soulful, '70s vibe, while the second is a rap that even contains humorous, self-referential lyrics. I then compare Udio to Suno, an existing AI music platform, by playing a few Suno-generated songs. While Suno is still impressive, I suggest that Udio represents a notable advancement in terms of the realism and emotional resonance of its music.  In the video, I also touch on the broader implications of AI music generation technology. I explore the potential for AI-generated radio stations, adaptive soundtracks in video games, and the democratization of music creation. Tools like Udio could enable aspiring artists to create professional-sounding songs without expensive equipment or extensive training. However, I acknowledge that this raises complex questions about the future of the music industry and the role of human creativity in an age of artificial intelligence. Despite these concerns, I express my enthusiasm for the rapid progress of AI music generation and the exciting possibilities it presents.",09:21,public,4/8/2024,"ai, artificial intelligence, jack roberts, suno ai, suno, udio, ai news, text to speec, gpt, chatgpt",31.356723721292454,1401,36,14,2,259,0,2

The automation works by feeding Perplexity AI a prompt and URL, which it analyzes to provide a summary, comment insights, and additional research data. This output is then sent to a Google Doc and passed through a router to three different GPT specialist agents that transform the content into posts for LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.  To set this up, I used Make.com, a no-code automation tool, and integrated Perplexity AI (which is 100% free). I also connected an OpenAI API key to utilize GPT-4 for the specialist agents. For the LinkedIn bot, I used Claude AI to generate custom instructions on how to structure the post, considering factors like optimal length, clarity, and engagement.  The process is highly customizable and scalable, with countless potential applications. While there are some costs involved, such as Make.com's monthly fees, ChatGPT Plus, and Perplexity AI credits, I found them to be reasonable for the level of automation achieved.
